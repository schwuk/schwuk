As you're here, you must be looking for me. I'm David, but you may know me as Dave or “Schwuk”.

I am a husband, father, engineering leader, author, and developer. I also cycle, run, hike, and used to powerlift.

Previously I was a school governor, and co-founder/organiser of technology user group “Code Cumbria”.
