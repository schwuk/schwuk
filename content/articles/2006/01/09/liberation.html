<p>A while ago my career took a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/10/21/career-advancement">new direction</a>. Before this I was a pretty dedicated code-monkey, deeply embroiled in the world of .NET and it&#8217;s associated technologies and culture. When <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> came along, I thought &#8220;great, I can finally contribute to Open Source using my C# &#38; .NET skills&#8221; and for a while I spent a lot of time working in and with Mono. I also spent a fair amount of time defending both Mono itself and my choice to use it.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I changed jobs now, and I&#8217;m really getting back into the whole &#8220;geeking for pleasure&#8221; bit. Along the way I came up with an idea for an application that would help out on of my fellow <a href="http://www.cumbria.lug.org.uk">LUGgers</a> and my first thought was to write it in Mono. Then I remembered that Jono had written something <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/projects/xamppcontrolpanel/">similar</a> using <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> &#38; <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/">PyGTK</a> (something I&#8217;ve tinkered with <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2004/08/31/interesting-comparison-part-2">before</a>) so I had a look at his code, played with it for a bit, discarded pretty much all of it and started again. Normally I would most likely have re-implemented in  Mono, yet this time &#8211; because I&#8217;ve not done any serious coding in C# for approximately six months now &#8211; I decided to stay with Python and found it:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>A refreshing change from Mono &#8211; everything I needed already installed in  Ubuntu 5.10 or was just an <code>apt-get</code> away. No <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/05/17/mono-from-source">compiling from source</a> to get the current version</li>
		<li>A nice little language and  environment to work in/with</li>
	</ol>


	<p>I&#8217;ve never been that <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/search?q=python">big a fan</a> of Python, but I&#8217;ve got to admit that combined with <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/">Glade</a> it really is powerful for <strong>quickly</strong> creating apps that have <strong>little or no dependencies</strong> (if you&#8217;re using a good distro). Sure if you&#8217;re a die-hard <span class="caps">IDE</span> person you&#8217;re going to struggle as it requires you to know more about the language and libraries you&#8217;re working with, but I fail to see how that is &#8220;A Bad Thing&trade;&#8221;.</p>


	<h3>Choice</h3>


	<p>Now this post isn&#8217;t just a retraction of my previous comments about Python &#8211; it relates to all langauges and frameworks.  My on-and-off affair with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is now back on again, and I find that &#8211; again due to taking a step back from .NET&#8217;isms &#8211; the things I disliked before aren&#8217;t really that bad. I&#8217;ve even bought the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">book</a> so that I can better understand it.</p>


	<p>So having taken a step back from commercial development practices has allowed me to re-evaluate the Free alternatives, and I&#8217;ve found them far from lacking. I&#8217;m not going to do a complete U-turn and take Aq&#8217;s attitude of &#8220;why waste time creating a new language/framework&#8221; as I think the achievement of Mono is not an insignificant thing. However now that I no longer rely so heavily on the technologies that drove the creation of Mono, I do understand his viewpoint though.</p>
