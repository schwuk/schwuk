<p>(Yes, this and the previous <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/01/03/resolve-revisited">post</a> herald one of my typical flurry of posts. Deal with it.)</p>


	<p>Like Aq., I too am <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/01/03/the-bloglines-plumber-again">frustrated</a> with the recent <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#95">outages</a>  of the Bloglines service. I&#8217;ve grown to rely on it, and when it is unavailable it is like a piece of me is missing (similar to, but <em>obviously</em> not as serious as, when my internet connection fails. &lt;shudder /&gt;). I know these problems are uncontrollable, but I find them incredibly frustrating nonetheless.</p>


	<p>So like Aq., I am now looking into the possibility of hosting my own (or possibly working with him, but duplication of effort is the foundation Open Source, Free Software and Linux are built on, and I do so hate to break tradition &lt;/sarcasm&gt;). Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I can do a better job than Bloglines, nor do I expect there to be less errors. In fact I expect there to be <strong>more</strong>, but they will be <strong>my</strong> errors that <strong>I* can (try to) fix. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/11/rolling-my-own">written</a>  in this vein before.</p>


	<p></strong>Having the right to make one&#8217;s own choices and of having the ability to act on them* is one of the definitions of empowerment, and this is some thing only Open Source and Free Software give us.</p>
