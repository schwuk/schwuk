<p>Around this time last year, I published a post entitled &#8220;<a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/01/02/new-year-resolve">New Year Resolve</a>&#8221; in which I outlined some of the things I wanted to achieve in the (then) coming year. I also said I would see how I did next year (er, now) so with the preamble over lets get on with it!</p>


	<h3>Immediate</h3>


	<p>Things I intended to complete quickly:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Re-implement my home gateway</strong> &#8211; Done. I switched to <a href="http://ipcop.org/">IPCop</a> as mentioned and have gone on to recommend it to and even carry out implementions for others.</li>
		<li><strong>Switch to Debian</strong> &#8211; Done, and I won&#8217;t look back.</li>
		<li><strong>Fix my Linode</strong> &#8211; Half-done. I switched it to Debian as threatened, which resolved all the problems at the time, but since then my Spam filtering solution has all but collapsed making me reach the point where I have considered letting GMail handle it all for me &#8211; until I found <a href="http://www.roundcube.net/">RoundCube</a> that is.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Ongoing</h3>


	<p>Things I intended to complete at some point:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Technical Writing</strong> &#8211; Sort of. I didn&#8217;t get anything written on the scale that I wanted, however I did get to <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/04/25/published">contribute</a> to a book.</li>
		<li><strong>Replace my website</strong> &#8211; Sort of. I started work on a Mono-based site (which I may finish at some point). However I <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/14/so-i-lied">succumbed</a> to the glamour of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby On Rails</a> and switched to <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/">Typo</a> instead.</li>
		<li><strong>Produce two pieces of software</strong> &#8211; No, for reasons I will explain later.</li>
		<li><strong>Become certifiable</strong> &#8211; No, for reasons I will also explain later.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>And there&#8217;s more&#8230;</h3>


	<p>I also came up with a few non-technical goals as well:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Become more productive &#38; organised</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;ve achieved this, but it will always be an ongoing thing.</li>
		<li><strong>Be consistant</strong> &#8211; No, but not all of it was my fault, which I will explain, er, now.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Annus Horribilis</h3>


	<p>This year my (non-immediate) family has suffered through a horrible set of events that thankfully will have a much better outcome than we imagined. However  this caused me to re-evaluate priorities  which culminated in a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/10/21/career-advancement">career direction change</a>. I said at the time:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Hopefully this will also give me chance to step back from focusing on the tech that I required for my job (e.g. .NET) and focus on the stuff that actually interests me â?? something Iâ??ve felt a lack of recently.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...and this has happily been the case. Of course this has been slightly marred by my new-found passion for gaming (especially on <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/12/15/halo-2-on-xbox-live">Xbox Live</a>), but I&#8217;m still finding time to do the geeky things I enjoy.</p>


	<h3>2006, the year of&#8230;</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m not going to come up with any (predictions|resolutions|tasks) for 2006, as I will have a busy enough year already. Last year saw a few lifestyle changes that the effects of should be quite noticeable this year.</p>
