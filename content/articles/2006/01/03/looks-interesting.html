<p>
    Games <strong>and</strong> juvenile humour &#8211; what more could you want?
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0456554/">Grandma&#8217;s Boy</a> (<a

<h3>...or maybe not&#8230;</h3>

        Overall rating within the entire universe of films: 4.0 / 10 Rating
        within the subset of movies significantly about video games: 9.5 / 10

<p>Still potentially worth seeing as the movie&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        &#8220;succeeded in one arena that almost every movie involving video
        games fails at miserably: it captured much of gaming culture pretty well
        to varying degrees of accuracy.&#8221;

<p>
    ...but it&#8217;s probably now going to be a rental (or wait until Sky picks
    it up and shows it forty-eight trillion times in a week) rather than a
    cinema trip for me.
