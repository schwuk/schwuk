	<p>Games <strong>and</strong> juvenile humour &#8211; what more could you want?</p>


	<p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0456554/">Grandma&#8217;s Boy</a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/grandmasboy/">Trailer</a>)</p>


	<h3>...or maybe not&#8230;</h3>


	<p>From Joystiq&#8217;s <a href="http://joystiq.com/2006/01/04/grandmas-boy/">not-really-a-review</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Overall rating within the entire universe of films: 4.0 / 10
Rating within the subset of movies significantly about video games: 9.5 / 10</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Still potentially worth seeing as the movie&#8230;</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;succeeded in one arena that almost every movie involving video games fails at miserably: it captured much of gaming culture pretty well to varying degrees of accuracy.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...but it&#8217;s probably now going to be a rental (or wait until Sky picks it up and shows it forty-eight trillion times in a week) rather than a cinema trip for me.</p>
