title: Ride him cowboy!

<p>Today I went with Mrs Schwuk to see <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0388795/">Brokeback Mountain</a> and in my opinion (which is, after all, what this site is for!) it deserves all the praise that is being lavished on it. It&#8217;s so much more than just a &#8220;gay cowboy&#8221; film (which I admit to referring to it as) &#8211; although it was worth noting that not everyone was aware of basic premise of the film as one couple walked out of the cinema once the &#8216;action&#8217; began!</p>


	<p>The only downside I can think of is that at times things can be quite slow, but it&#8217;s worth staying with (which is not much of a chore at all really). This may well have be down to the fact that I&#8217;ve only seen action/blockbuster type movies at the cinema recently so it was a significant change of pace for me.</p>


	<p>Having put up with Mrs Schwuk&#8217;s infatuation with <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0005132/">Heath Ledger</a> for quite some time now means I am familiar with his other work, and he definitely deserves the oscar for this outing. <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0350453/">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> was very good as well, but it really was Heath&#8217;s film.</p>


	<p>...and yes I know that the title of this post is a cheap gag, but I liked it.</p>
