	<p>Following the <a href="http://blog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/9/rails-1-1-5-mandatory-security-patch-and-other-tidbits">advice</a> of the Rails core team, I have upgraded my server to run Ruby on Rails 1.1.5:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>This is not like “sure, I should be flossing my teeth”. This is “yes, I will wear my helmet as I try to go 100mph on a motorcycle through downtown in rush hour”. It’s not a suggestion, it’s a prescription.</p>

	<p>Seeing as I&#8217;m currently only hosting two rails applications &#8211; this blog and <a href="http://flickrlilli.org.uk">Flickrlilli</a> (which was used to source the above image) &#8211; I deemed it a fairly safe thing to do. I also took the opportunity to update this blog to <a href="http://typosphere.org/trac/">Typo</a> edge (revision <a href="http://typosphere.org/trac/changeset/1208">1208</a> to be precise).</p>


	<p>Both upgrades were completely painless and had the minimum of downtime which is always a nice thing.</p>
