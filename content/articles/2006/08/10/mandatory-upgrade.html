    Following the

    of the Rails core team, I have upgraded my server to run Ruby on Rails
    1.1.5:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        This is not like “sure, I should be flossing my teeth”. This is “yes, I
        will wear my helmet as I try to go 100mph on a motorcycle through
        downtown in rush hour”. It’s not a suggestion, it’s a prescription.
    </p>

    Seeing as I&#8217;m currently only hosting two rails applications &#8211;
    this blog and <a href="http://flickrlilli.org.uk">Flickrlilli</a> (which was
    used to source the above image) &#8211; I deemed it a fairly safe thing to
    do. I also took the opportunity to update this blog to
    <a href="http://typosphere.org/trac/">Typo</a> edge (revision
    <a href="http://typosphere.org/trac/changeset/1208">1208</a> to be precise).
</p>

<p>
    Both upgrades were completely painless and had the minimum of downtime which
    is always a nice thing.
