<p>Looks like the previous <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/08/10/mandatory-upgrade">update</a> isn&#8217;t as watertight as we&#8217;d like. Until 1.1.6 is out the door, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2006/08/10/working-round-the-rails-showstopper">workaround</a>.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re running Typo from svn, update to the head revision to get this fix.</p>
