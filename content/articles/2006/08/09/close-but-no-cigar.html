<p>Want to hear a couple of respected .NET developers talk about Open Source? Go and listen to the episode of of Hanselminutes entitled <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=38">Open Source Options</a>. I found it both infuriating and enlightening at the same time.</p>


	<p>How can it be both? Because it&#8217;s two <strong>commercially-oriented</strong> software developers discussing a concept they don&#8217;t seem to fully grasp or understand. I sure this is in part due to the format and constraints of the show &#8211; Scott Hanselman seems to be an intelligent guy, and I&#8217;m confident he knows more about Open Source than came across <strong>but</strong> it didn&#8217;t come across that way. It was interesting to see how Open Source is perceived by them, and their take on some of the problems we face.</p>


	<p>Go listen and see what you think.</p>
