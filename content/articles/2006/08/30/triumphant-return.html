<p>I&#8217;m now back after a weeks holiday in France, preceded by an intensive week of work at my day job handing off a particularly long running project to its new <strike>victim</strike> maintainer.</p>


	<p>Unfortunately I now seem to have been struck down by some sort of bug that whilst not serious enough to prevent me from work, it does make the experience pretty unpleasant.</p>


	<p>In other news it looks like I should have an article published in the next issue of <a href="http://linuxuser.co.uk/">Linux User &amp; Developer</a> and I&#8217;m writing a couple more for other &#8216;outlets&#8217;. Futher bulletins as events warrant.</p>
