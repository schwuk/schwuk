<p>Following on from my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/08/10/mandatory-upgrade">previous</a> <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/08/10/and-another-one">posts</a>,  Ruby on Rails 1.1.6 is now <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/10/rails-1-1-6-backports-and-full-disclosure">out</a> along with full disclosure of the vulnerability. There is also a new Rails security announcement <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/10/new-security-mailing-list">mailing list</a> which can only be A Good Thing&trade;.</p>


	<p>However whilst I think their speed of reponse has been excellent, their initial &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221; stance was inappropriate for both a) an Open Source project and b) one written in an interpreted language, and the rapid succession of releases implies they reacted too hastily.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>The issue is in fact of such a criticality that we’re not going to dig into the specifics. No need to arm would-be assalients[sic].</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...means nothing.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Regarding security through obscurity, we’ll release the full details of this issue once everyone has had a fair chance to upgrade their system. Source transparency is of little comfort if you just had your system compromised before you got a chance to apply the patch.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>... means nothing too. Anyone wanting to know how the vulnerability worked (i.e. attackers) simply looked at the source, whilst the people not sure if they needed to upgrade <strong>right now</strong> were left in the dark unless they knew the internals of Rails intimately (i.e. not many).</p>


	<p>Fortunately for me, the applications hosted here are low traffic and a brief downtime was acceptable to remain secure but I bet this was a real headache for the large Rails driven sites.</p>
