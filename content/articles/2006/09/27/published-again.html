<p>It&#8217;s always nice to see your work in print. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; online publishing is great, but there&#8217;s just something&#8230;<em>nice</em> about holding something you&#8217;ve written. Now it&#8217;s not the <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/04/25/published">first time</a> something I&#8217;ve written has been printed, but this time it is directly attributable to me.</p>


	<p>On page 50 of <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=172">Issue 66</a> of <a href="http://linuxuser.co.uk">Linux User &amp; Developer</a> you will find my article about Open Source software for children, inspired by my childrens recent painless conversion to Linux.</p>


	<p>Go buy, read, enjoy, and provide me with feedback please. Oh and keep an eye out &#8211; there is more where that came from (hint, hint)!</p>
