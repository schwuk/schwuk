<p>...you don&#8217;t get.</p>


	<p>My childrens school sent out a questionnaire, which we returned this morning. It was the usual stuff &#8211; Are you happy with the amount of homework? What improvements would you make to the school facilities? etc.</p>


	<p>It was the final question that caught my eye though: <em>Any other comments?</em> A fairly innocuous question you may think, but I saw a perfect platform for me:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I would like to see more use of Free and Open Source software used in education.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I also added a note that I was happy to discuss this with them. Nothing may come of it, but on the other hand&#8230;</p>
