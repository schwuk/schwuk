<p>News is starting to leak out that <a href="http://www.larkware.com/editorials/vmware.html">VMWare&#8217;s successor to <span class="caps">GSX</span> Server will be free</a>. This is a significant and bold move from <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> that will put more than a few <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/default.mspx">noses</a> out of joint. I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMWare Workstation</a>, and it would seem that the release of their free <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">Player</a> was a precursor for this. Hopefully like their current offering &#8211; and Workstation and Player &#8211; it will support Linux.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Mike Gunderloy</a> (a person whose opinion I &#8211; and many, many others &#8211; value) thinks this is a very good thing:
<blockquote>This is, frankly, a market-changing move, and one that I expect a lot of people will take advantage of. Server virtualization is a wonderful technology; with it you can take a single physical server and partition it into multiple virtual servers that don&#8217;t step on each other. For example, I&#8217;ve taken a single Dell 1850 dual-processor server and used VMware <span class="caps">GSX</span> to simultaneously run a Subversion server, a Cruise Control .NET server, a Windows Software Update Services server, a Data Protection Manager Server, and several more servers &#8211; without the hassles of worrying about whether any of that software will conflict or fight over ports.</blockquote>I&#8217;ve no doubt there will be an &#8220;Advanced Server&#8221; version that you do have to pay for, but I can imagine a lot of people trying &#8211; and sticking with &#8211; the free one.</p>
