<p>Last night I got to take part the <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/one_last_campfire_test_before_launch.php">performance testing</a> 37signals were doing. Quite a few people who were in the chat with me were disapproving, claiming it was too basic, and that other web-based chats were better. I did keep pointing out to them that all this was being done in a pure <span class="caps">HTML</span> environment &#8211; no plugins required &#8211; but they still bemoaned the lack of features.</p>


	<p>Hopefully today that should be dealt with as 37signals have <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/campfire_screen_shot_and_movie.php">released</a> a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/campfireshot.png">screenshot</a> of thhe app and a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/campfiretranscripts.mov">movie of the transcript browser</a> that shows much of the functionality that I can happily confirm was missing from the test.</p>


	<p>It looks like they have another winning application on their hands &#8211; I can see this being useful for all sort of discussions, and whilst it&#8217;s unlikely to win over anyone who uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC"><span class="caps">IRC</span></a> on a regular basis, it&#8217;s definitely more accessible and user-friendly than <span class="caps">IRC</span>.</p>


	<p>I can imagine myself using it. Not exclusively, but certainly using it.</p>
