    After my adventures in
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/02/07/sensitive-skin"
        >improving my Spamassassin setup</a
    >
    last night, this morning I awoke to a pleasant surprise&#8230;
</p>

<p><strong>No spam!</strong></p>

<p>
    It&#8217;s not perfect (I have a couple of custom procmail recipes that
    caught some stuff sa let through), but so far it&#8217;s the best it&#8217;s
    been since I
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/05/09/same-blog-new-distro"
        >switched</a
    >
    distros on my server.
</p>

<p>Now to see how it does over the course of the day&#8230;</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>
    <ins
        >Just checked, and so far I&#8217;ve received 87 pieces of spam since I
        made the changes. Only two made it through Spamassassin, and they got
        caught by my procmail recipes.</ins

<p>
    <ins
        >In other words, I&#8217;ve not received a <strong>single</strong> piece
        of spam today.</ins
    >
</p>

<p><ins>Result!</ins></p>
