title: Putting out the Campfire

<p>
    So <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> have launched their new
    &#8220;simple group chat for business&#8221; product
    <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> &#8211; don&#8217;t try
    to <a href="http://123.campfirenow.com/signup">signup</a> for it though,
    because it&#8217;s limited
    <del
        >to 500 users a day and I fully expect it to mimic the 360 shortages for
        a while</del
    >.
</p>

    <ins
        >Whilst scanning Technorati for posts about Campfire, I came across Jim
        Coudal&#8217;s invite to join their room as a guest. It was locked when
        I first tried, but later I got in and Jason Fried himself was in there.
        I asked him a few questions about how he thought the launch had gone,
        and when they were going to allow more signups to which he replied:</ins

    <p>signups are on. go for it. we opened 1000 more slots.</p>

        >So I did, and now have a shiny new trial account. I&#8217;ve given the
        tyres a kicking with some of the #lugradio faithful, and they seem
        impressed with it although as regular
        <span class="caps">IRC</span>&#8217;ers they&#8217;re not the target
        market. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll try it with some people I work (i.e. not die
        hard geeks) to see what they think.</ins

    I got a
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/02/10/sitting-round-the-campfire"
        >chance</a
    >
    to play with Campfire the other day, and I said:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        It looks like they have another winning application on their hands â?? I
        can see this being useful for all sort of discussions, and whilst itâ??s
        unlikely to win over anyone who uses <span class="caps">IRC</span> on a
        regular basis, itâ??s definitely more accessible and user-friendly than
        <span class="caps">IRC</span>.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    I still stand by that, and I&#8217;m sure they will make a lot of money from
    it (although my reaction is why pay for what is already available for free),
    but I&#8217;m now thinking &#8220;why re-invent the wheel&#8221;?
</p>

<p>
    One of the problems with the whole web 2.0 culture is walled gardens. Sure
    some (maybe even most) of the apps have an <span class="caps">API</span> of
    some sort for you to interact with them, but generally you&#8217;re only
    allowed to play in their little world. Campfire is a prime example of this.
    There are <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">open standards</a> that Campfire
    could have been built on top of &#8211; they&#8217;re good enough for
    <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google</a> after all &#8211; that
    would have saved 37signals the whole wheel re-inventing bit and allowed
    their applications to interact with other services (if they so desired, but
    it&#8217;s not a requirement &#8211; Google Talk was closed at first) and
    also allowed people who are more comfortable with desktop applications to
    participate. On the Campfire site they have a page
    <a href="http://campfirenow.com/better/">explaining</a> why it&#8217;s
    better than your current choice of IM/chat, but it&#8217;s all marketing and
    anyone with any moderate computer experience will know that there are
    already clients and networks that provide a large part of what they&#8217;re
    saying doesn&#8217;t exist.
</p>

<p>
    Campfire <span style="text-decoration: underline">does</span> have some very
    nice features, and I&#8217;d like to see a competing application (not a
    service) that implements some of these on top of
    <span class="caps">XMPP</span>.
</p>

<p>Any takers?</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>It looks like I&#8217;m not the only one who is underwhelmed:</p>
