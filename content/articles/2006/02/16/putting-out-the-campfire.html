<p>So <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> have launched their new &#8220;simple group chat for business&#8221; product <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> &#8211; don&#8217;t try to <a href="http://123.campfirenow.com/signup">signup</a> for it though, because it&#8217;s limited <del>to 500 users a day and I fully expect it to mimic the 360 shortages for a while</del>.</p>


	<p><ins>Whilst scanning Technorati for posts about Campfire, I came across Jim Coudal&#8217;s invite to join their room as a guest. It was locked when I first tried, but later I got in and Jason Fried himself was in there. I asked him a few questions about how he thought the launch had gone, and when they were going to allow more signups to which he replied:</ins></p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>signups are on. go for it. we opened 1000 more slots.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p><ins>So I did, and now have a shiny new trial account. I&#8217;ve given the tyres a kicking with some of the #lugradio faithful, and they seem impressed with it although as regular <span class="caps">IRC</span>&#8217;ers they&#8217;re not the target market. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll try it with some people I work (i.e. not die hard geeks) to see what they think.</ins></p>


	<p>I got a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/02/10/sitting-round-the-campfire">chance</a>  to play with Campfire the other day, and I said:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>It looks like they have another winning application on their hands â?? I can see this being useful for all sort of discussions, and whilst itâ??s unlikely to win over anyone who uses <span class="caps">IRC</span> on a regular basis, itâ??s definitely more accessible and user-friendly than <span class="caps">IRC</span>.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I still stand by that, and I&#8217;m sure they will make a lot of money from it (although my reaction is why pay for what is already available for free), but I&#8217;m now thinking &#8220;why re-invent the wheel&#8221;?</p>


	<p>One of the problems with the whole web 2.0 culture is walled gardens. Sure some (maybe even most) of the apps have an <span class="caps">API</span> of some sort for you to interact with them, but generally you&#8217;re only allowed to play in their little world. Campfire is a prime example of this. There are <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">open standards</a> that Campfire could have been built on top of &#8211; they&#8217;re good enough for <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google</a> after all &#8211; that would have saved 37signals the whole wheel re-inventing bit and allowed their applications to interact with other services (if they so desired, but it&#8217;s not a requirement &#8211; Google Talk was closed at first) and also allowed people who are more comfortable with desktop applications to participate. On the Campfire site they have a page <a href="http://campfirenow.com/better/">explaining</a> why it&#8217;s better than your current choice of IM/chat, but it&#8217;s all marketing and anyone with any moderate computer experience will know that there are already clients and networks that provide a large part of what they&#8217;re saying doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>


	<p>Campfire  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does</span> have some very nice features, and I&#8217;d like to see a competing application (not a service) that implements some of these on top of <span class="caps">XMPP</span>.</p>


	<p>Any takers?</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>


	<p>It looks like I&#8217;m not the only one who is underwhelmed:</p>
