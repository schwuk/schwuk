<p>Although I find the underlying technologies and concepts very interesting, I&#8217;ve not yet bought into the whole <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a> thing. Admittedly I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/11/rolling-my-own">trying out</a> a lot of the services that fall under the 2.0 moniker, but I&#8217;m still not on the bandwagon.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve recently been adding some new subscriptions to my <a href="http://bloglines.com/public/schwuk">blogroll</a> (yes, I&#8217;ve stopped using <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/01/03/gregarius-under-lighttpd-and-fastcgi">gregarius</a> for now &#8211; I need the <a href="http://bloglines.com/mobile">mobile support</a> Bloglines provides), and amongst them was <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</a>. He &#8211; and a lot of sites he links to &#8211; keep talking about up-and-coming new services, and two that are frequently mentioned are <a href="http://www.newsvine.com/">Newsvine</a> and <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">CoComment</a>. Both of these are in the &#8216;closed&#8217; beta stage where, just like GMail used to be (I believe it&#8217;s more open now), it&#8217;s by invite only<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. Being only mildly curious I put my name to receive notification when the service became available, but lo and behold less than 24 hours later I was given access to both! Not so &#8216;closed&#8217; after all!</p>


	<p>So far I&#8217;ve signed up to both, and given Newsvine more of a trial than CoComment. Although both <em>seem</em> like good solutions, I&#8217;ve got a feeling Newsvine will quickly become bogged down by the (always more vocal) negative members of the community, and as I tend not to comment on blogs much, and the blogs I do tend to comment on are either homegrown or <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/help#dev-platform">not supported</a> CoComment may be of (very) limited use to me.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s some good commentary of Newsvine and its ilk here:</p>

	<p>The latter post has the following memorable comment:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>It&#8217;s what happens when you point the mic at the P.A. system.</p>
