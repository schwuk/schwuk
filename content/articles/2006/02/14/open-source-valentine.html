<p>Last night my (young) son declared he wanted to make a Valentine&#8217;s card for someone in his class, and he wanted my help to make it so off to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Batcave!</span><br /><br />...<br /><br />Er, I mean my office.<br /><br />Now my main machine (which runs Windows) was busy rendering video for a project, so I switched to my <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> machine instead. I often tend to bypass Linux for media related stuff &#8211; I know it can handle most tasks, but I know that Windows definitely can do what I want and I&#8217;m more familiar with the applications. However due to time constraints (like bed time) I had no choice but to rely on the penguin.<br /><br />First things first, he wanted a nice picture on the front, so <a href="http://www.openclipart.org/">Open Clip Art</a> was my first port of call. We easily found a <a href="http://openclipart.org/clipart/recreation/holiday/valentines/heart-ballons_benji_park_01.svg">suitable</a> image but it was in <span class="caps">SVG</span> format so instead of using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the <span class="caps">GIMP</span></a> as I&#8217;d expected,&nbsp; I&nbsp; had to turn to <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> (I suppose I could have used <a href="http://www.scribus.org.uk/">Scribus</a> but I didn&#8217;t think of it at the time). We knocked up a quick layout, and then it was time to print.<br /><br />At this point I have to say that Inkscape&#8217;s print dialog <span style="font-weight: bold;">sucks!</span><br /><br />Frustrated by the inability to print I instead exported it to a <span class="caps">PNG</span> file, opened this in the <span class="caps">GIMP</span> and printed it from there to my printer (which incidentally was on another machine and networked via <a href="http://www.cups.org/"><span class="caps">CUPS</span></a>).<br /><br />All of this (including installing Inkscape &#8211; thank you apt-get) was managed in a very short space of time, and my son was over the moon with it. I&#8217;m by no means a graphic artist or a designer so I can&#8217;t comment on the capabilities of the Free applications I mentioned here, but they allowed me to get the job done and I will have to invest more time in playing with them in the future.</p>
