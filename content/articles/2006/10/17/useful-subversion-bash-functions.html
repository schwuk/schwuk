    Inspired by bbum&#8217;s
    <a
        href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2006/03/13/useful-subversion-shell-aliases/"
        >Useful subversion shell aliases</a
    >
    I decided to to try them out for myself. Of course nothing is ever easy and
    they needed to be converted from aliases to functions to work under bash, as
    bash doesn&#8217;t support passing arguments according to Google.
</p>

<p>
    You can read bbum&#8217;s post for more details but the idea behind these is
    that after you have run <code>svn status</code> you can
    copy&#8217;n&#8217;paste the output and have the results opened in your
    editor of choice.
</p>

<p>
    So here are my functions, preconfigured to use
    <a href="http://vim.org">GVim</a> and its diff function:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
 M () { svn diff "$*" | gvimdiff -; }
 G () { svn diff "$*" | gvimdiff -; }
 U () { svn diff "$*" | gvimdiff -; }
 R () { svn diff; }
 A () { true; }
 D () { true; }
 I () { true; }
 ? () { true; }
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Place these in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> and you&#8217;re ready to roll.
</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>
    As <a href="http://www.sungate.co.uk/">davee</a> points out below, you could
    use his <a href="http://colordiff.sourceforge.net/">colordiff</a> tool for
    viewing the output instead.
