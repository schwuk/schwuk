<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to make up my mind whether to attend <a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.co.uk">LinuxWorld</a> this year but with my recent <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/09/27/published-again">foray</a> back into the world of (technical) writing, as yet unpublished work under my belt and a not insignificant project (which will be announced soon) in the pipeline I&#8217;ve decided it will be worth going to, if only for the &#8216;networking&#8217; which sounds so cold-blooded but in this context seems apt.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be there for both days with &#8211; as yet &#8211; <del>no plans for the Thursday evening (before making the trip home)</del> so if anyone wants to meet up, let me know.</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>


	<p>Due to a change in travel plans I shall now be on a train on Thursday evening so any meetups will have to take place early Wednesday evening or during the expo.</p>
