<p><em>This one is only for the benefit of #lugradio dwellers</em></p>


	<p>In response to neuro&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://neuro.me.uk/phated/">Phated statistics</a> I issued the following challenge:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Schwuk challenges someone to make up a short story using all of the words on http://neuro.me.uk/phated/</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...and after some discussion I&#8217;ve come up with the following rules:</p>


<div class="image float-right"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/schwuk/143427282/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/45/143427282_e70607e80f_m.jpg" width="211" height="240" alt="Phated Snogs Statistics" /></a></div>

	<ol>
	<li>The screengrab shown here is the list everyone must work off</li>
		<li>Only the verbs shown can be used; they must be used at least once, and no more than the count shown next to them</li>
		<li>Adjectives, nouns, etc. can be added to make the story make sense</li>
		<li>Any of the nicks listed may be used any number of times</li>
		<li>Phated&#8217;s nick must be used at least once</li>
		<li>nlindblad&#8217;s nick (not on the list) must be used at least once</li>
		<li>The rules may change at any time (ala Calvinball)</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Before I added (and used) the final rule, Phated came up with the following which I think she should be commended for:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Chuckles. Chortles. It&#8217;s all she has. She stabs, kills, hugs her victims, curls into them, huggling; she will steal, popping bullets. She likes it when they flee, bounce. Wants what she takes and takes what she wants. Spanks and smacks, and sidles away.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<h3>Update</h3>
