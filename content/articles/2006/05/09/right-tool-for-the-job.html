	<p>I&#8217;ve always had a printer attached to my computer. I don&#8217;t always use it &#8211; although I have been more recently &#8211; but it&#8217;s always there if I want it. My current printer is an <span class="caps">EPSON</span> Stylus Photo 890 and it&#8217;s always done a pretty good job with whatever I threw at it. It is a bit thirsty when it comes to ink though.</p>


	<p>Recently I acquired a <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Printers/Direct_Photo/Selphy_DS810/">Canon <span class="caps">SELPHY DS810</span></a> and I am seriously impressed it with. I never saw the point in a printer that was specifically for printing photos but now I&#8217;m convinced. Although it can connect to your computer, I&#8217;ve found it be even better when used standalone.</p>
