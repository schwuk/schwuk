    I&#8217;ve mentioned (<a

        >here</a

    This moved on to the second stage the other day when Schwuklet #2 (my 5 year
    old son) finally got his own computer.
</p>

<p>
    I took a bit of a different tack this time. With Schwuklet #1&#8217;s
    computer I took the easy path of Windows XP because a) I was in a hurry and
    didn&#8217;t have the time to dedicate to customising a Linux install to my
    requirements and b) she had a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratz">Bratz</a> game that required
    Windows. I know, I copped out. This time &#8211; primarily because I was
    going to be (re)using much older hardware &#8211; I decided to invest the
    time in getting Linux to suit my needs. I started off, as always, with
    <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 5.10. I know Dapper is almost
    here, but Breezy will suffice for now. Because of the machine&#8217;s poor
    spec, I passed over <span class="caps">GNOME</span> and instead used
    <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> which is much &#8216;lighter&#8217;. I
    also installed
    <a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">Tux Paint</a>,
    <a href="http://gcompris.net/">GCompris</a> and
    <a href="http://childsplay.sourceforge.net/">Childsplay</a> then customised
    the menus so only those apps, Firefox, Thunderbird and
    <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim</a> were available to him.

<p>
    Internet access &#8211; as previously discussed &#8211; is well restricted.
    Email is a non-published address and heavily filtered anyway, and Gaim is
    there so he can chat to me, his mother and his sister (how sad!) when
    we&#8217;re online (which I am most of the day).
</p>

<p>
    This brings onto my &#8220;proud moment&#8221;: my first IM conversation
    with my son. How cool is that!
