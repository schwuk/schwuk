<p>Unfortunately <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/06/08/sixth-and-final-attempt">declaring</a> that I was no longer &#8216;attempting&#8217; running has left me without any ideas of what to use as titles for my &#8216;runlogs&#8217;. I do have an alternative plan in the works though, so you&#8217;ll just have to indulge me for now.</p>


	<p>Another run today. Practically same time and distance as yesterday. I felt I hadn&#8217;t done as well because as well as a couple of (&lt; 10s) breaks I had a couple of <b>very</b> short walks. I think the reason it panned out was because I introduced some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fartlek">Fartlek</a>. Nothing serious, I just made sure that a few stretches were run at a much faster pace than normal.</p>


	<p>Overall I&#8217;m feeling pretty good &#8211; I&#8217;m running faster and more consistantly, and I&#8217;m feeling (and seeing) the effects. My legs are a bit sore after todays run (more than yesterday or the day before), so I may skip tomorrow to avoid any injury, but I&#8217;ll see how I feel in the morning.</p>
