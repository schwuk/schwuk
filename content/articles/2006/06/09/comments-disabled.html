<p>Ah the joys of running bleeding edge software. It would appear that <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/trac/ticket/849">comments</a> <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/trac/ticket/881">are</a> <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/trac/ticket/892">broken</a> in Typo svn at the moment. I tried a couple of the patches without success so instead I&#8217;ve disabled comments until it&#8217;s a) fixed or b) I fix it.</p>
