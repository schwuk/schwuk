<p>I first got involved in <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">Geocaching</a> in 2001, and was an fairly active member of the community &#8211; even if I didn&#8217;t actually do any &#8216;caching! I even got interviewed for a a newspaper (either The Guardian or The Independent) article about.</p>


	<p>Fast forward to 2005. I read with envy about davee&#8217;s (a fellow #lugradio dweller) <a href="http://www.sungate.co.uk/?p=183">first find</a>. I was almost inspired anough to get off my backside and go and seek one myself.</p>


	<p>Fast forward again to the present day. A friend has lent their Bluetooth <span class="caps">GPS</span> so I can testdrive some satellite navigation software before our planned trip to France later this year. Suddenly the lightbulb goes off above my head. I can finally go Geocaching! So yesterday I bundle the kids into the car and off we go to my chosen destination which was <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=432d8383-f88d-4dca-9940-6d4ab264553d">Solway View 2</a> as it is practically on my doorstep (you can see my house from it &#8211; in fact you can see most of North-West Cumbria and South-West Scotland!). The satnav &#8211; <a href="http://www.i-go.com/en/">iGO</a> in this case &#8211; took me almost directly to it (as I discovered after I&#8217;d found it), and then I switched over to <a href="http://wimobi.com/gpsdash/overview.ppc2.php">GPSDash</a> for the final leg. After a bit of hunting high &#38; low (you&#8217;ll understand if you ever go there) I spotted it in a place I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d already checked. The kids were over the moon about finding it and getting to take something. This particular cache was quite small, and I didn&#8217;t have anything suitable so I returned earlier today to put some items in.</p>


	<p>I thoroughly enjoyed it (because I got to play with geek toys), and the kids enjoyed the &#8220;treasure hunt&#8221; aspect so this is definitely something we&#8217;ll be doing again. In fact I&#8217;ve got a few lined up for one of my rare visits to the office tomorrow&#8230;</p>
