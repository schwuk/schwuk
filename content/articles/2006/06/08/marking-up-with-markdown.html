<p>
    I&#8217;ve been using
    <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> for a long time now.
    Mainly because the previous incarnation of this site was running
    <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a>. I was aware of
    alternatives, but due to inertia when I
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/14/so-i-lied">switched</a> to
    Typo I carried on using Textile. It has a few annoyances (e.g. no easy
    formatting for `<code />` blocks without resorting to HTML). As the saying
    goes "a change is a good as a rest" I decided to mark my
    [upgrade](http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/06/08/running-typo-svn-on-debian-stable-sarge)
    to Typo svn by switching to using
    [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with
    [Smartypants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) for both
    posts and comments. If you want to play with Markdown, you can do so on the
    [Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus/).
