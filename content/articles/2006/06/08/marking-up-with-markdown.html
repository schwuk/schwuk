<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> for a long time now. Mainly because the previous incarnation of this site was running <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a>. I was aware of alternatives, but due to inertia when I <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/14/so-i-lied">switched</a> to Typo I carried on using Textile. It has a few annoyances (e.g. no easy formatting for `<code />` blocks without resorting to HTML).

As the saying goes "a change is a good as a rest" I decided to mark my [upgrade](http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/06/08/running-typo-svn-on-debian-stable-sarge) to Typo svn by switching to using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with [Smartypants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) for both posts and comments.

If you want to play with Markdown, you can do so on the [Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus/).</p>
