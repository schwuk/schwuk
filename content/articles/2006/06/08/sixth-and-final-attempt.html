<p>Bright blazing sunshine. Hour long lunchbreak. New running shorts. What else could I do?</p>


	<p>This post marks the sixth and final attempt to go running. Why final? Because I&#8217;m enjoying it enough that I&#8217;m no longer attempting it &#8211; I&#8217;m just doing it.</p>


	<p>Sticking to the shorter circuit is paying off. I know that I&#8217;ve done it, but I&#8217;m not dead after doing it. This meant that I could go the day after my last attempt. I know that&#8217;s not advisable, and I probably won&#8217;t be doing that when I&#8217;m onto the longer runs but I want to make the most of the good weather.</p>


	<p>I ran the same direction as yesterday, and the pedometer claimed practically the same distance (<strong>just</strong> over 2&frac12; miles) although I was quicker today. I still haven&#8217;t re-calibrated it &#8211; I&#8217;m going to drive the circuit (it&#8217;s all road based) to see how it compares before I do.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve a now added a few additional items to my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/20/second-attempt">list</a>:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Running/lightweight vest/t-shirt/top</li>
		<li>A (working) shower</li>
		<li><span class="caps">NIKE</span>+iPod</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Let me explain each of them.</p>

            <ol>
	<li>Running top</li>
	</ol>


	<p>My brother-in-law (who runs marathons) once told me a story about his brother who being typically disorganised turned up to run a marathon without his gear. He managed to borrow some shoes and shorts, but ended up wearing a normal t-shirt. He crossed the finishing line with bleeding nipples.</p>


	<p>Today I had a glimpse of how he felt. I was just going to run in just shorts (to help my tan) but decided to wear a (normal cotton) vest to prevent blinding anyone with my pale skin. When I got home I vowed to buy a proper running top <span class="caps">ASAP</span>!</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Shower</li>
	</ol>


	<p>We have two bathrooms. One has a broken shower (and is incidentally filled with junk), and the other has a shower head attached to the taps. I&#8217;m currently having to make do with a &#8220;hand shower&#8221; whilst sitting in the tub.</p>


	<p>My mission for this weekend is to:</p>


	<p>1. Empty the second bathroom
2. Get the shower working or replace it
3. Put up a shower curtain of some sort (I&#8217;m told this is quite important)</p>


	<p>Later in the year I may invest in a power shower, but for now I&#8217;ll be happy with something that a) I can stand up in and b) drops water from above without me holding it.</p>


	<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">NIKE</span>+iPod</li>
	</ol>


	<p>OK this is me being sucked in by <span class="caps">NIKE</span> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/nike/">Apple&#8217;s marketing</a>, but I just can&#8217;t help it.</p>


	<p>Basically it&#8217;s a transmitter that goes into your <span class="caps">NIKE</span>+ shoes and a receiver that connects to your iPod nano. The nano becomes your pedometer. On top of this there&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/"><span class="caps">NIKE</span>+</a> site which allows you to track, share and compare your runs.</p>


	<p>If I had an iPod nano and <span class="caps">NIKE</span> shoes I&#8217;d be clamouring to get this being the good consumer that I am. I don&#8217;t however, so this one is much further down my wishlist (plus it&#8217;s not even out yet).</p>
