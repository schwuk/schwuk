<p>
    After numerous attempts to upgrade this site to the latest version of
    <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/trac/">Typo</a> and the current version
    of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I&#8217;ve finally
    succeeded. The things that tripped me up were:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Debian `stable`
        <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/interpreters/ri1.8">ships</a>
        Ruby 1.8.2. Whilst this is fine for Rails 1.1 I couldn&#8217;t
        <a href="http://www.recentrambles.com/pragmatic/view/51">migrate</a> to
        Typo svn&#8217;s schema which I thought meant I needed 1.8.4. I
        didn&#8217;t
    </li>
    <li>
        I was running Postgres 7.4.7 (again Debian
        <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/misc/postgresql">default</a>
        which <strong>was</strong> causing the migration problems
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Once I&#8217;d figured my way past those I&#8217;m now running Postgresql
    from <a href="http://backports.org/">Debian Backports</a> and Ruby 1.8.4 of
    my own concoction, with Rails 1.1 (from gems, not debs). A side effect of
    this is that my old theme was broken on Typo svn so for the time being
    I&#8217;ve switched to
    <a href="http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish">Scribbish</a> which is
    a fantastic theme for for general use and to base your own on &#8211; which
    I shall be doing shortly.
</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I did to solve the package issues I had.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Backporting Ruby 1.8.4 from `unstable`</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Because there aren&#8217;t any offical backports of Ruby 1.8.4 available,
    you&#8217;ll need to roll your own from `unstable` Here&#8217;s how:
</p>

<p>Add the following line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`:</p>

<pre><code>deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main</code></pre>

<p>
    <strong
        >You&#8217;ll probably want to change the repository
        <span class="caps">URL</span> to suit.</strong
    >
</p>

<p>
    You&#8217;ll need to do an `apt-get update` then you can carry out the
    following as `root`:
</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get source ruby1.8
$ apt-get build-dep ruby1.8
$ apt-get install devscripts
$ cd ruby1.8-1.8.4
$ debuild -us -uc</code></pre>

<p>Your deb&#8217;s will be placed in the parent folder of `ruby1.8-1.8.4`.</p>

<p>You may want to do the same for `ri`, `rdoc`, `irb` and `rake` (I did).</p>

<ol>
    <li>Installing Postgresql 8.1</li>
</ol>

<p>
    This is much easier to do, but be warned if you&#8217;re upgrading from 7.4:
    you should backup all your databases and remove (or better yet) purge your
    existing installed packages. If you don&#8217;t you can end up in a mess (I
    did).
</p>

<p>Add the following line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://www.backports.org/debian sarge-backports main</code></pre>

<p>
    Edit the file `/etc/apt/preferences` (you may need to create it) and add the
    following:
</p>

<pre><code>Package: *
Pin: release a=sarge-backports
Pin-Priority: 200</code></pre>

<pre><code>Package: postgresql-8.1
Pin: release a=sarge-backports
Pin-Priority: 999</code></pre>

<pre><code>Package: postgresql-common
Pin: release a=sarge-backports
Pin-Priority: 999</code></pre>

<pre><code>Package: lsb-base
Pin: release a=sarge-backports
Pin-Priority: 999</code></pre>

<pre><code>Package: ssl-cert
Pin: release a=sarge-backports
Pin-Priority: 999</code></pre>

<p>Now installing is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install postgresql-8.1</code></pre>

<p><b>This</b> is why I love Debian and it&#8217;s offspring.</p>
