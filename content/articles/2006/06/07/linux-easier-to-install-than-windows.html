<p>I got a new work laptop the other day, an <span class="caps">IBM</span> (or rather Lenovo) ThinkPad <span class="caps">T41</span>. Before I start using it for real work I decided to try out the latest and greatest Ubuntu on it.</p>


	<p>The new LiveCD based install is a doddle, and come reboot time <strong>everything</strong> worked. Networking (wired <strong>and</strong> wireless), hotkeys, sound, display. No tweaking, just worked.</p>


	<p>How good is that?</p>


	<p>I also threw XP at it just to see how that faired. It installed well enough, but you couldn&#8217;t do anything with it. No network, no hotkeys, no sound, and 800&#215;600 display.</p>


	<p>Although I should really be using Windows on it, I&#8217;m sticking with Ubuntu for now because I can&#8217;t be bothered &#8216;fixing&#8217; XP enough to make it work.</p>
