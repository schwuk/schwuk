<p>
    I got a new work laptop the other day, an <span class="caps">IBM</span> (or
    rather Lenovo) ThinkPad <span class="caps">T41</span>. Before I start using
    it for real work I decided to try out the latest and greatest Ubuntu on it.
</p>

<p>
    The new LiveCD based install is a doddle, and come reboot time
    <strong>everything</strong> worked. Networking (wired
    <strong>and</strong> wireless), hotkeys, sound, display. No tweaking, just
    worked.
</p>

<p>How good is that?</p>

<p>
    I also threw XP at it just to see how that faired. It installed well enough,
    but you couldn&#8217;t do anything with it. No network, no hotkeys, no
    sound, and 800&#215;600 display.
</p>

<p>
    Although I should really be using Windows on it, I&#8217;m sticking with
    Ubuntu for now because I can&#8217;t be bothered &#8216;fixing&#8217; XP
    enough to make it work.
