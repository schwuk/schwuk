<p>Nine months after my last attempt I decided it was time to pull on my running shoes again.</p>


	<p>This time I decided to start a bit more gradually so I cut the second, third and fourth sections off my circuit to make a shorter one. Unfortunately this means running over a mile along a busy main road &#8211; not ideal. My plan is that when I can a) run the short course in under 20 minutes and b) complete it without stopping/pausing/walking then I shall move back onto my original course.</p>


	<p>My fourth attempt took place about two and a half weeks ago. I took our dog with us &#8211; he thoroughly enjoyed it &#8211; and I felt I did fairly well. 2.6 miles in just over 23 minutes (of actual running). I had the best intentions of going again a few days later, but they came to nothing. I was stiff for a few days, but not too bad.</p>


	<p>My fifth attempt was the morning. I ran the route in reverse (to avoid the hill at the end) and again took the dog with me. Schwukette drove past about half-way round and she took the dog in the car leaving me to complete it on my own. Even though I felt I did better my pedometer claims I ran less distance in more time (and burned less calories) which just seems wrong so I&#8217;m not posting any stats until I&#8217;m sure that the pedometer is calibrated properly.</p>


	<p>The weather is fantastic at the moment so I asked Schwukette to pick me up some running shorts in town. I might as well get a tan whilst I&#8217;m out!</p>

	<p>Taking the dog with me on the runs seemed like a good idea, but it&#8217;s not. He has to be on a lead and will frequently stop to smell the flowers (or somesuch) and mark the route in his own special way. I&#8217;ll try the next couple without him and see how I do.</p>
