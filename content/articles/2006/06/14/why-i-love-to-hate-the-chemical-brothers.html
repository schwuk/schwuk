<p>Intentionally skipping the weekend, over the last eight days on six I&#8217;ve run 2&frac12; miles per day in an average time of nearly 24&frac12; minutes. This is skewed slightly because the <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/06/07/fourth-and-fifth-attempts">first</a> of the six runs was accompanied by my dog, and I ended running for a total of 32 minutes. If I ignore that result then my average is just under 23 minutes which is much better.</p>


	<p>Todays run was completed below my average time, and involved only one stop! When running my circuit clockwise there a flat of about 140 yds then a downhill of maybe 200 yds. I started running my circuit clockwise because when I originally ran it anti-clockwise I hated this hill at the end. It&#8217;s better getting it over with at the beginning, but it&#8217;s still awkward, especially trying to tackle it with any speed. Today though I treated it as a warm up &#8211; I went at an easy pace until I got to bottom, did some more stretching then tackled the rest of the run. I&#8217;m not sure if it was because of doing, or general improvement on my part but I didn&#8217;t feel the need for a break on the rest of run which is a great progress.</p>


	<p>I drove the circuit last night, and it looks like my pedometer is <strong>slightly</strong> out, but not enough to be concerned about. I&#8217;ll correct it at some point.</p>


	<p>Lessons learnt so far:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><b>Don&#8217;t run too soon after a meal.</b> The previous two runs before today were done in the evening about an hour after the family meal. Both times I got a very nasty stitch which I don&#8217;t normally</li>
		<li><b>Don&#8217;t hold anything.</b>  I was using my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/10/30/o2-xda-exec-a-brief-review">Pocket PC Phone</a> as my <span class="caps">MP3</span> player. Due to it&#8217;s size, I had to hold it in my hand, which got very annoying. For the last two runs I&#8217;ve used my daughter&#8217;s Â£20 <span class="caps">MP3</span> player that hangs round your neck. Audio quality sucks (as you&#8217;d expect from a device with that price) but running is much easier when your hands are free.</li>
		<li><b>Choice of listening is important.</b> I started out listening to music, then I switched to podcasts (more on this in another post). Now I&#8217;ve switched back to music. I&#8217;ve tried various types of music (again, more on this in another post), but the best type I&#8217;ve found has been from the Electronic genre. I discovered this by adding Hey Boy Hey Girl from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000J8EK">Surrender</a> by The Chemical Brothers to one of my playlists. As soon as the track got going my pace naturally picked up and I pushed myself harder whilst listening to it. I felt I performed much better during that run and it was all down to the music, but boy was I tired afterwards!</li>
