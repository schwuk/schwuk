<p>I normally use <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> for the images I use in posts, but for my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/06/01/dancing-with-the-devil">Vista Initial Impressions post</a> I decided to try out the new <a href="http://allyoucanupload.webshots.com/">All You Can Upload</a> image hosting service from <span class="caps">CNET</span>.</p>


	<p>It does one thing, and does it well. Image hosting. That&#8217;s it. No albums, no tagging, nothing else. You upload an image, and it gives you links to use. If you lose the links, you lose the image. There&#8217;s no registration required, so it&#8217;s pretty anonymous as well.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/05/09/right-tool-for-the-job">appreciating</a> specialised tools more these days, and this fits the bill nicely.</p>


	<p>TechCrunch has some good <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/29/cnets-allyoucanupload-is-disruptive/">coverage</a> of it, especially how it may affect the others already in the same niche.</p>
