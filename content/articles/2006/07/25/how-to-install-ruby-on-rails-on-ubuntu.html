<p>The <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsOnUbuntuDebianTestingAndUnstable">instructions</a> for installing <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> have always been lumped in with the Debian ones, and over time the page has gotten pretty messy. I&#8217;ve recently been having numerous discussions with various people about the perceived difficulties in installing Rails and its offspring on Ubuntu (and Debian). I&#8217;d been meaning to write an installation guide for Ubuntu for quite a while now to address this, but I never seemed to get around to it.</p>


	<p>Whilst at LugRadio Live this weekend, I attended the Ruby on Rails <acronym title="Birds Of a Feather">BOF</acronym> during which someone mentioned an install guide and I said I was going to be (re)writing one. This prompted me to pull my finger and actually do it, so without further ado let me introduce the new guide for <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsOnUbuntu">installing Ruby on Rails on Ubuntu</a>. I decided to create a new page instead of updating the old one not because that&#8217;s the Open Source Way but rather because the old one may still be useful to people.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m planning on creating a similar (probably almost identical) guide for Debian, and I need to add a couple more bits and pieces to it. I&#8217;m also planning on duplicating the content to the equivalent Ubuntu wiki <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RubyOnRails">page</a>.</p>
