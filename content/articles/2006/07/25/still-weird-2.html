<p>Looks like I was <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/07/19/now-that-was-weird">wrong</a> the other day &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t stray markup that was causing problems. There seems to be something fundamentally broken with my <a href="http://typosphere.org/trac">Typo</a> installation.</p>


	<p>Everytime I make a post I get the <code>[FATAL] failed to allocate memory</code> error. Sometimes if I repeatedly retry (with re-starting the application inbetween) it lets a post through, but it is starting to get <strong>very</strong> frustrating.</p>


	<p>Right now I&#8217;m torn between trying to determine and (hopefully)  fix the problem &#8211; although I&#8217;m hitting a brick wall with that right now &#8211; or switching to something else.</p>
