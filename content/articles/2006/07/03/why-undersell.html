<p>In his latest <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/07/03/jokosher-remote-and-mini-jokosher">post</a>
Aq. talks about two new directions for the <a href="http://lugradio.org">LugRadio</a> offspring <a href="http://www.jokosher.org/">Jokosher</a> of which both sound excellent.</p>


	<p>However he mentions the release schedule for Jokosher:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>the development of a plugin system is on the roadmap for Jokosher 0.2 (at the moment, we&apos;re in bugfix mode for 0.1, due for release in three weeks at LugRadio Live 2006)</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>...and my immediate reaction was &#8220;why 0.1? why not 1.0?&#8221;. I know the Open Source way is to release early and release often &#8211; which is A Good Thing&trade; by the way &#8211; but I do object to the way projects pick &lt; 1 version numbers to indicate their maturity (or lack thereof), because they&#8217;re underselling themselves. One of the common complaints levelled at Linux and Open Source Software is that nothing is ever finished, and this is because a vast number of projects never reach that golden 1.0 milestone. It hasn&#8217;t stoppped them being in widespread use, but they still give the impression they&#8217;re not ready yet. Why didn&#8217;t they hit 1.0? Because they reached the point where they were &#8216;good enough&#8217; and didn&#8217;t need to go any further.</p>


	<p>If it&#8217;s good enough to be used by the others, then give it a 1.0 version number to show that. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s not complete &#8211; as 37 signals would <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">say</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Build half a product, not a half-ass product</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>It obviously does something otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t be releasing it yet, so say that. If it&#8217;s not then you shouldn&#8217;t be &#8211; you won&#8217;t stop yourself or the early adopters from using it by doing this and in the long run you&#8217;ll end up with a much better first release.</p>


	<p><strong>Just in case this post does get misinterpreted in someway, I&#8217;m using Jokosher <b>purely</b> as an example here. I&#8217;ve no idea how &#8216;mature&#8217; it is, nor do I have an opinion on whether they should or shouldn&#8217;t release it at LugRadio Live. I just don&#8217;t want the team behind it &#8211; or any other project &#8211; to undersell themselves.</strong></p>
