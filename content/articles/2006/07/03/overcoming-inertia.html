<p>A few weeks ago I was <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/category/running">running</a> almost every day, and thoroughly enjoying it. Then I stopped. I stopped for a fairly good reason &#8211; I came down with a summer cold and really didn&#8217;t feel like running so I thought I&#8217;d pick it up again in a few days.</p>


	<p>This was 19 days ago!</p>


	<p>I kept saying to myself that I&#8217;m going running today, or I&#8217;ll start again tomorrow but it just didn&#8217;t happen. I don&#8217;t know why &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t a conscious decision, something just kept getting in the way and when I did get time I had no motivation (&#8220;tomorrow&#8221; is <strong>so</strong> easy).</p>


	<p>Even yesterday which was an absolutely glorious day (although probably too hot) I couldn&#8217;t overcome the inertia. As with all procrastination, I knew I was putting it off and was frustrated with myself for doing so but didn&#8217;t actually do anything about it. I decided enough was enough, and this morning I was going to get up a 6AM and go for a run.</p>


	<p>Of course this didn&#8217;t happen. I got up, reset the alarm for 7AM and went back to sleep.</p>


	<p><strong>However</strong> once my wife took the Schwuklets to school I grabbed my trainers and headed out. <b>Now</b> I feel great, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to running again.</p>


	<p>The nice thing about inertia is that applies to rest <strong>and</strong> movement.</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Inertia is the tendency of a body to maintain its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia_%28disambiguation%29">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>So now I&#8217;m running again I&#8217;ll keep going until something &#8216;trips me up&#8217;.</p>


	<p>The other thing I re-discovered is that I <b>really</b> enjoying running. Even though I&#8217;m listening to something (was podcasts, then music, now I&#8217;m back to podcasts) my mind is free to wander. I don&#8217;t need to think (too much) about the actual act of running, so I&#8217;m free to think about anything else and I&#8217;ve had quite a few &#8216;lightbulb&#8217; moments this way.</p>


	<p>Physical <b>and</b> mental exercise &#8211; what more could you want?</p>
