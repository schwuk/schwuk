<p>It&#8217;s amazing how quickly you get out of shape.</p>


	<p>One of the side-effects of me <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/07/03/overcoming-inertia">not running for a while</a> was that I noticeably put weight back on. Thinking back over the 19 days (19!) I wasn&#8217;t running, the amount of rubbish I ate was quite bad. So starting&#8230;now&#8230;I&#8217;m kicking off an experiment.</p>


	<p>This isn&#8217;t a diet &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to lose weight per se, just get into shape &#8211; it&#8217;s a change of direction. For the next seven days I&#8217;m only going to:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Drink water or fruit juice &#8211; no tea or fizzy drinks</li>
		<li>Eat no sweets, crisps or biscuits</li>
		<li>Eat <b>at least</b> <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/HealthAndSocialCareTopics/FiveADay/fs/en">five portions</a> a day</li>
		<li>Eat breakfast everyday (it&#8217;s amazing how easy this is to skip)</li>
		<li>Eat lunch everyday (yes, I do often skip lunch)</li>
		<li>Have no takeaways</li>
	</ul>


	<p>We&#8217;ll see how I do&#8230;</p>
