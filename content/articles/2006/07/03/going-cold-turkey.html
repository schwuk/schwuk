<p>It&#8217;s amazing how quickly you get out of shape.</p>

<p>
    One of the side-effects of me
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/07/03/overcoming-inertia"
        >not running for a while</a
    >
    was that I noticeably put weight back on. Thinking back over the 19 days
    (19!) I wasn&#8217;t running, the amount of rubbish I ate was quite bad. So
    starting&#8230;now&#8230;I&#8217;m kicking off an experiment.
</p>

<p>
    This isn&#8217;t a diet &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to lose weight per se,
    just get into shape &#8211; it&#8217;s a change of direction. For the next
    seven days I&#8217;m only going to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Drink water or fruit juice &#8211; no tea or fizzy drinks</li>
    <li>Eat no sweets, crisps or biscuits</li>
    <li>
        Eat <b>at least</b>
        <a

            >five portions</a
        >
        a day
    </li>
    <li>
        Eat breakfast everyday (it&#8217;s amazing how easy this is to skip)
    </li>
    <li>Eat lunch everyday (yes, I do often skip lunch)</li>
    <li>Have no takeaways</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#8217;ll see how I do&#8230;</p>
