<p>Well, I&#8217;m here at <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/2006">LugRadio Live</a> and thoroughly enjoying it!</p>


	<p>I arrived yesterday afternoon in time for the afternoon food and drinks. Met up with the four large gents and bunch of other cool guys (spepayne, dotwaffle and Shane MacGowan(sp?) amongst them). Aqurion was also there (who I already knew).</p>


	<p>Checked into the Quality Chin, and was pleased to discover free WiFi.</p>


	<p>Back down into town for the evening meetup at the Hogshead. A great evening, with a chance to catch up with some old friends (Russ &#38; Jen from Cumbria <span class="caps">LUG</span>, Kat &#38; Dave Goodwin), meet lots of new ones (MacSlow, Conner and the other irish guy, John running the Ubuntu stand, the guy with <span class="caps">MAME</span> cabinet whose name I can&#8217;t remember, Roy) and to put faces to nicks for people I know from #lugradio (Xalior, lejt, mrben, neuro).</p>
