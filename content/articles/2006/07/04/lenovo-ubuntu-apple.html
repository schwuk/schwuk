<p>Mark Pilgrim did <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/05/30/bye-apple">it</a>.</p>


	<p>Then Cory Doctorow did <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/29/mark_pilgrims_list_o.html">it</a> as well.</p>


	<p>O&#8217;Reilly has <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/06/ubuntu_linux_a_threat_to_mac_o.html">noticed</a> them doing it.</p>


	<p>...and now /. (that bastion of journalism) is <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/03/1934251">talking</a> about it.</p>


	<p>What is it?</p>


	<p>People (whom some would call alpha geeks) are switching from Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/"><span class="caps">OS X</span></a> to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. Noteworthy in itself, but so far I&#8217;ve not seen anyone make the connection that both Mark and Cory have switched to Ubuntu on <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/us/">Lenovo</a> kit (the hardware formally known as <span class="caps">IBM</span>).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not suprised they chose this combination &#8211; Lenovo + Ubuntu is a very good match.</p>


	<p>In fact in my office right now I&#8217;ve got four pieces of Lenovo Kit:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>1 x <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T41"><span class="caps">T41</span></a> laptop (which this post is being written on) which theoretically dual boots, but I&#8217;ve not booted into XP since I install Ubuntu on it</li>
		<li>3 x <a href="http://www-131.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=4611686018425069087&#38;storeId=10000001&#38;langId=-1&#38;categoryId=2580518&#38;dualCurrId=1000073&#38;catalogId=-840"><span class="caps">M51</span></a> towers, 2 of which are running Ubuntu 6.06, and the other has an ailing install of XP which is still there purely because of inertia</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Installing Ubuntu on the Thinkpad was a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/06/07/linux-easier-to-install-than-windows">dream</a> compared to getting XP running at the same feature level. It&#8217;s not just the latest and greatest Ubuntu that works so well with this hardware &#8211; before Dapper was released I ran Breezy on the two of the M51s.</p>
