<p>Inspired by <a href="http://townx.org/blog/elliot/ignoring_personal_junk">Elliot</a> I&#8217;ve added my Ruby on Rails related posts to <a href="http://rubycorner.com">RubyCorner</a>.</p>


	<p>I subscribe to quite a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_aggregator">planet</a>-style feeds, and I don&#8217;t mind the odd off-topic post, but a disproportionate number of personal posts to a planet that&#8217;s technical in nature soon winds me up.</p>


	<p>So I&#8217;m not going to inflict the same on others.</p>
