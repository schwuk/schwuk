<p>I received this in my inbox the other day (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Once again it&#8217;s that time of the year when we start cranking up
        the activity for this year&#8217;s LinuxWorld Conference and Expo.
    </p>

    <p>
        We&#8217;d be really grateful for your support (and for you to flag up
        the event to your members) as I&#8217;m sure your user group members
        would be interested in what&#8217;s going on at the event. We have a
        host of speakers from both technical &amp; business background and
        support from the press; <span class="caps">SOCITM</span>; OFE;
        <span class="caps">OSC</span>; plus all the key associations.
        <b>This is the only major event for Linux in the UK</b> and we also have
        the .org village, a free seminar programme, The Great Linux Debate plus
        the exhibition itself.
    </p>

<p>
    The only major event for Linux in the UK?!? Have they not heard of the great
    gathering of geeks that is known as
    <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/live/2006/">LugRadio Live</a>? Which takes
    place <b>this</b> weekend (22nd &amp; 23rd of July, 2006) no less.
</p>

<p>
    Whilst I&#8217;ll concur that <span class="caps">LRL</span> is not of the
    same scale as LinuxWorld, it is still an impressive event especially
    considering it is almost wholly community based.
</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;m planning on travelling down Saturday morning, returning Sunday
    evening and residing at the Quality Chin on Saturday night.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately there are too many good things going on, so I won&#8217;t be
    able to see everything I want to. My definites are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ruby on Rails In Actuality <span class="caps">BOF</span></li>
    <li>#lugradio Meet and Greet <span class="caps">BOF</span></li>
    <li>LugRadio Live and Unleashed (of course)</li>
    <li>The Hour of Power&#8212;short demos of cool stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Beyond that there are various talks I would like to catch, but I have the
    feeling there will be many, many distractions!
