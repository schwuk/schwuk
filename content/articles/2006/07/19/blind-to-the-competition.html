<p>I received this in my inbox the other day (emphasis added):</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Once again it&#8217;s that time of the year when we start cranking up the activity
	for this year&#8217;s LinuxWorld Conference and Expo.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;d be really grateful for your support (and for you to flag up the event to your members) as I&#8217;m sure your user group members would be interested in what&#8217;s going on at the event.  We have a host of speakers from both technical &amp; business  background and support from the press;  <span class="caps">SOCITM</span>; OFE; <span class="caps">OSC</span>;  plus all the key associations. <b>This is the only major event for Linux in the UK</b> and we  also have the .org village, a free seminar programme, The Great Linux Debate plus the exhibition itself.</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>The only major event for Linux in the UK?!? Have they not heard of the great gathering of geeks that is known as <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/live/2006/">LugRadio Live</a>? Which takes place <b>this</b> weekend (22nd &amp; 23rd of July, 2006) no less.</p>


	<p>Whilst I&#8217;ll concur that <span class="caps">LRL</span> is not of the same scale as LinuxWorld, it is still an impressive event especially considering it is almost wholly community based.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m planning on travelling down Saturday morning, returning Sunday evening and residing at the Quality Chin on Saturday night.</p>


	<p>Unfortunately there are too many good things going on, so I won&#8217;t be able to see everything I want to. My definites are:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Ruby on Rails In Actuality <span class="caps">BOF</span></li>
		<li>#lugradio Meet and Greet <span class="caps">BOF</span></li>
		<li>LugRadio Live and Unleashed (of course)</li>
		<li>The Hour of Power&#8212;short demos of cool stuff</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Beyond that there are various talks I would like to catch, but I have the feeling there will be many, many distractions!</p>
