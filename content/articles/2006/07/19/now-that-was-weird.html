<p>My previous <a href="http://schwuk.com:3000/articles/2006/07/19/blind-to-the-competition">post</a> was delayed by 48 hours due to a very weird problem in <a href="http://typoshpere.org/trac">Typo</a> that needs further investigation.</p>


	<p>Whenever I tried to publish the post, the mongrel instance for this application would disappear in a puff of smoke leaving only the following message:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>[FATAL] failed to allocate memory</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>That&#8217;s it. Nothing else.</p>


	<p>By process of elimination, I figured out that it may be some stray markup in the post I was writing &#8211; I was quoting an email &#8211;  but in the end all I removed was a fairly innocuous <span class="caps">URL</span> that wasn&#8217;t even embedded in a link.</p>


	<p>One day I&#8217;ll sit down and figure it out, but until then normal service is resumed.</p>
