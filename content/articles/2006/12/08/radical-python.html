<p>I have another article in the <a href="http://linuxuser.co.uk/index.php?page=shop.product_details&#38;flypage=shop.flypage&#38;product_id=39&#38;category_id=7&#38;manufacturer_id=0&#38;option=com_virtuemart&#38;Itemid=63">latest issue</a> of <a href="http://linuxuser.co.uk">Linux User &amp; Developer</a> entitled RADical Python.</p>


	<p><img src="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/images/stories/issue_68.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>It is an introduction to Rapid Application Development with PyGTK, and I&#8217;m very pleased with the result. Of course real feedback (instead of my own ego massaging) is always welcome.</p>


	<p>I am intending to follow this article up with a series on Python development (with a twist) &#8211; further bulletins as events warrant.</p>


	<p>In the mean time go and pick up a copy!</p>
