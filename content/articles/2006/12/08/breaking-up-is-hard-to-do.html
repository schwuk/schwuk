<p>This is the bit where I should point out all the good things about my blog engine of choice &#8211; Typo &#8211; before explaining to it that it&#8217;s not Typo&#8217;s fault, things just aren&#8217;t working out.</p>


	<p>Stuff that.</p>


	<p>Typo is good, but it is bloated and keeps dying on my server for no reason and I&#8217;ve had enough. Other RoR apps are ticking over quite nicely on this box, so why does Typo have an issue?</p>


	<p>Sorry Typo, it&#8217;s not me &#8211; it&#8217;s you. Pack your bags and sling your hook.</p>


	<p>Now to start trawling the classifieds to find a new blog engine before I succumb to temptation and write my own.</p>


	<p>(This is a roundabout way of say that this site has been <strong>**</strong> recently and I&#8217;m finally going to do something about it.)</p>
