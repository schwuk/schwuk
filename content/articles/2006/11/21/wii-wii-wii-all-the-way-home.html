<p>I had intended to let the new game consoles pass me by. I resisted the initial &#8220;got to have one&#8221; when the Xbox 360 came out &#8211; a decision I am very happy with after trying it at friends houses. Although I was a dedicated PlayStation fan, the Playstation 3 holds no attraction to me. The <a href="http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/wii/?l=enGB">Wii</a> did appeal, mainly because it eschews the now common &#8220;graphics are king&#8221; theme and actually tries to innovate. The price was also attractive, but I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to get one at launch and so would wait to see what they were like after they had launched.</p>


	<p>That was the plan, anyway.</p>


	<p>Since a Nintendo DS Lite is the gift of choice in my house this year, a bit of surfing was in order. During such a outing I stumbled across Amazon&#8217;s pre-order information for the Wii, and the fact that they would be taking them today &#8211; long after other outlets have (over)sold their allocation. Pre-orders opened this morning and closed five minutes later, but not before I&#8217;d got my order in for a console and a copy of Zelda.</p>


	<p>Now I just need to convince schwukette that it doesn&#8217;t <strong>really</strong>  need to go under the tree&#8230;</p>
