So my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2008/02/27/no-were-not-ready">attempt</a> to listen to every LUGRadio episode ever failed big style. :(

However <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/">LUGRadio Live 2008</a> approaches, so the time for planning is afoot. My hotel is booked (as of today), and it's time to get <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1191">the word out</a> about the event.
