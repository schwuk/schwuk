Wow. Has it really been a month since I posted? Time flies and all that...

If you haven't heard of <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> by now you must be living under a rock. Although <a href="http://twitter.com/schwuk">my Twitter</a> usage has been, well, <a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/schwuk">zero</a> for a while now I've made sure that my nick has been <a href="http://identi.ca/schwuk">registered</a> at identi.ca. Who knows - I might even get around to using it...

Of course the age-old problem is that I need to maintain accounts on Twitter and identi.ca (and all the others, but I've ditched most of those) whilst they remain walled gardens.

Much has been said already by others about identi.ca, so I won't rehash any of that here. Of course they get brownie points for being <a href="http://laconi.ca/">Open Source</a> and supporting <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>. Once they add SMS and API support I think it will really start to take off.

Whilst browsing feeds today I came across the announcement for <a href="http://www.nokia.com/betalabs/chat">Nokia Chat</a>. Initial reaction: oh great, another IM/Twitter clone. Their USP is the location information. If your phone has a GPS (like mine) it knows where you are, and with Nokia Chat you can let others know that. Nice, but there's still something missing... So I read the FAQ and found this little nugget:
<blockquote><strong>Can I connect with my friends on other IM services?</strong>
You can add friends who have Google Talkâ„¢ and other XMPP/Jabber based IM services to your friend list, see their statuses, and chat with them.</blockquote>
Now that's a win. Chat with location services that's <strong>not</strong> in a walled garden. I'm going to download the client and see what it is like.
