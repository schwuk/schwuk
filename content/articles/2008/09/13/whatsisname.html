Since everyone else is doing it...

Previously I shared Emma Jane's <a href="http://emmajane.net/node/828">predilection</a> for names taken from the Lord of the Rings. At various points I've had Aragorn, Frodo, Bilbo, Merry &amp; Pippin (two identical machines), Faramir &amp; Boromir (same machine, dual boot), Arwen, Treebeard, Saruman and Sauron. See if you can guess which were running Microsoft Windows...

I thought Treebeard was a fitting name for my current laptop (anyone who's seen it will know why), but when I recently switched to 64-bit (and wiped Vista in the process) I renamed it to Hagrid - mainly because at the time I was re-re-reading the Harry Potter books. Treebeard lives on in it's old 32-bit incarnation for now, but I suspect he will be gone soon - I'm very happy with my 32 extra bits.

Since I switched naming schemes Severus has also joined my network.

The rest of my current machines are named quite unimaginatively: Xbox, Xbox 360, Wii, Gatekeeper (my IPCop box), and iPhone. I did go through a phase of assigning names to network devices (like access points) but I grew out of that.

Schwuklet #2 also has a tendency to name things, although he has his own influences: he calls our car Anakin. Should I be proud that he's following in my footsteps or sad that he thinks Star Wars always had six episodes?
