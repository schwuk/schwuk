After much procrastination, and then frustration - the nice weather arrives, I want to get out there and do things, and I go and get sunburnt effectively curtailing physical activities for a while - I finally dragged myself out for a run again this morning.

I thoroughly enjoy running, although I admit to being a bit of a fair weather runner, but actually gettting out to do it can be a bit of a performance. First I need to locate all my running gear, then my pedometer, then my listening device of choice which of course needs updating with new tracks or podcasts, and while I'm at it I might set up a new playlist or tweak an existing one. Before I know it at least 30 minutes has passed since I made the decision to go out and actually getting close to leaving the house.

This morning I was better prepared: I knew where all my running gear was, and I deliberately chose to forgo the technological accoutrements that I normally take. No X300 Sports Tracker, no iPod Nano, no Nokia N95. I didn't even take a watch.

Without all that junk, I found the experience quite liberating. I wasn't worrying about my current speed, or which track was currently playing, and without the phone there were no other distractions. I just ran, and I definitely feel I ran better for it. Obviously as a card carrying geek I love the toys, and I love tracking my stats and performance, but it is easy to forget that they really don't matter.

I'm not saying I'm going to be running 'naked' everytime, but I will be doing it again and I thoroughly recommend you try it as well. Just grab your trainers and go.
