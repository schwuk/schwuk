<p>Or &#8220;Buh-bye Google Analytics&#8221;.</p>


	<p>As most of the commentary on my previous <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2008/1/15/target-market">post</a> about some statistics from this site (as reported by Google Analytics), the figures seemed&#8230; wrong.</p>


	<p>Even though the Google Analytics code is included on every page I serve, the two obvious causes were:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>People were blocking it (this seems more common than I realised)</li>
		<li>It&#8217;s broken in some undefinable way</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Seeing as I have full access to my server logs, I decided to go directly to the proverbial horses mouth and see how the numbers work out from there.</p>


	<p>The results are interesting to say the least.</p>


	<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> These statistics are purely for the same period &#8211; January 2008 up to the date of the this post. This means there may be some discrepancy between the GA figures in my other post and this one.</em></p>

	<p>Bit of a difference, isn&#8217;t there?</p>

	<p>Hmm. Some confusion there.</p>


	<h4>...and the moral of the story is:</h4>


	<p>Look before you&#8230;</p>


	<p>No, wait, too many cooks&#8230;</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s not right. It&#8217;s never work with animals, children, <strong>or</strong> a third party statistics package that relies on JavaScript. <strong>Especially</strong> when you have access to your own logs. So the real moral is <strong>don&#8217;t be lazy</strong>. Here endeth the lesson.</p>
