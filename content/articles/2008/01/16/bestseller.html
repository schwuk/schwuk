<p>Just did a quick check on how my book &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1847191665?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=schwukcom-21&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1634&#38;creative=6738&#38;creativeASIN=1847191665">Managing Software Development with Trac and Subversion</a> &#8211; was doing on Amazon UK. They had stock earlier in the week, but it&#8217;s all gone now &#8211; that can only be a good thing!</p>


	<p>I was also really pleased to see that I had made into the top 100,000 bestsellers &#8211; number 94,492 to be precise. Considering I&#8217;ve seen books ranked over the million mark, I&#8217;m very happy with my current position.</p>
