<p>Unless you have been living under a rock for the past 24-odd hours, you will have heard about the new Macbook Air ultra-slim laptop from Apple. Reactions seem to be falling into two categories:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>It&#8217;s the latest must have gadget</li>
		<li>Apple have missed the target</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Since everyone else is talking about it, I thought I would join in the fun.</p>

            <p>In Web Worker Daily, Judi Sohn <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/01/16/morning-after-reaction-to-macbook-air-g4-cube-again/">wonders</a> whether the Air will suffer the same fate as the G4 Cube (remember those?). No beating around the bush for GearCrunch, who think that it <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/01/15/macbook-airhead-why-apples-new-laptop-is-basically-useless/">&quot;is bascially useless&quot;</a>. At CenterNetworks the &#8220;common man&#8221; <a href="http://www.centernetworks.com/macbook-air-thoughts">take</a> is that it has just enough bang for the buck. Stuart Colville is pondering (what I&#8217;m pondering) <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2008/01/15/macbook-air-launched-but-will-it-fly/">whether the Air will fly?</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve skipped the &#8220;must have it&#8221; links because they&#8217;re plentiful and subject to the infamous Reality Distortion field.</p>


	<p>In a nutshell, I think the Air is a fantastic design, but I&#8217;m not sure what market Apple is aiming at.</p>


	<p>I think the price (<em>sans</em> solid state drive) is too close to the MacBook Pro, and the killer feature (its slimness) combined with its shortcomings (1 <span class="caps">USB</span>, new connectors, no optical drive) don&#8217;t make the deal any more attractive. I suspect it will only be bought by poseurs and people with too much money (i.e. multiple machines) &#8211; basically Apple die-hards.</p>


	<h4>Feature-full or feature-less?</h4>


	<p>Lets talk about those shortcomings for a minute. A common thread I&#8217;ve picked up on in the other posts is that it is just not a <em>serious</em> laptop with no optical drive nor audio input ports and only one <span class="caps">USB</span> port. Now I may be biased due to using Linux, but I can count the number of times I use my optical drive in a month on one hand (and occasionally no hands). Is it really that important? Audio input for me means one thing &#8211; Skype (or any other VoIP) &#8211; and having compared a <span class="caps">USB</span> headset to a standard Line-In, there is no comparison so the lack of audio input doesn&#8217;t bother me either. As for the single <span class="caps">USB</span>, have people not heard of <span class="caps">USB</span> hubs? I rarely use more than one <span class="caps">USB</span> device at a time, if at all. The simple fact is that the Air is not a MacBook Pro or desktop replacement, but many seem to be missing this important point.  The final nail in the coffin for the Air though is its size. It is just too big. No, I&#8217;m not confused &#8211; it&#8217;s lack of, er, depth cannot be ignored &#8211; but the footprint is too big for an ultra-portable.</p>


	<h4>Remote Disk, meet apt-get</h4>


	<p>Apple are trying to compensate for the lack of optical drive by giving us the software to turn any nearby Mac into a networked drive. Nice feature (as long as you remember to carry around the Remote Disk media with you), but I think I&#8217;ve been spoilt by years of Linux use where software is only an click or a command away. Even when I used Microsoft Windows we could just share our CD drives with a couple of clicks, and most software (excluding games of course) would be happy to install. These days though if I want it, I just apt-get it. Why bother with disks for software at all?</p>


	<p>If Apple is serious about digital distribution (and everything indicates they are) then they need to address this shortcoming.</p>


	<h4>Putting my money where my mouth is</h4>


	<p>...or rather back in my wallet. If I were to be given an Air (or a very significant discount on one) I&#8217;d be quite happy, providing it was running Ubuntu of course! However if I were looking for a new laptop today then for that sort of money I&#8217;d probably get a MacBook Pro, but if I was looking for an ultra-portable then I would look elsewhere. Give me something the size (and ideally the price) of the EeePC but with better performance and I&#8217;d be sold. If they&#8217;d priced the Air between the MacBook and the MacBook Pro, I would be tempted. As it stands today, I do think it is a fantastic design, but that alone is not a good enough reason to buy one.</p>


	<p>Maybe it is the next G4 Cube after all&#8230;</p>
