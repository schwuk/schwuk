<p>On his new blog <a href="http://writetodone.com/">Write To Done</a>, Leo Babauta talks about <a href="http://writetodone.com/2008/01/09/how-to-write-without-distractions/">how to write without distractions</a>. I wanted to look at a couple of his points from the <span class="caps">FOSS</span>/Linux/Ubuntu perspective.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <blockquote>
		<p><strong>3. Use Writeroom. Writeroom</strong> if you’re on a Mac, or some other similar software (<strong>Writer.app</strong> is another good Mac writing program, and <strong>DarkRoom</strong> works well for the PC — I’ve used all three and love them).
bq. Basically, these programs are for writing text, and nothing else. They block out the rest of your computer with a black (or otherwise faded) background, so that you have the text … and that’s all. They aren’t chock-full of features like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice. You write in full-screen mode, with no distractions.</p>

	<p>Since I first saw <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">Writeroom</a> I&#8217;ve been looking for something similar for Linux, but to no avail. Of course I can get a similar effect by switching to a virtual console and just using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, but that&#8217;s just not as&#8230;shiny. As you would expect there is an online alternative &#8211; <a href="http://writer.bighugelabs.com/">Writer</a> &#8211; but having a browser open sort of misses the point doesn&#8217;t it?</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>4. Shut down everything else.</strong> Got other programs running? Shut them down if possible. Not just your browser, but your mail program, <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader, games, graphics program, anything. Sure, if you’re using one of the minimalist writing programs mentioned above, they’ll be blocked from view, but trust me, it’s still too much of a temptation to press a few keys and switch over to another app. Shutting everything down is a smart move.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I see where he&#8217;s going with this one, but I have to say <strong>virtual desktops to the rescue</strong>. Leave the other applications open, but put them on different desktops. Couple this with turning off notifications (#7 on his list) for e-mail, <span class="caps">IRC</span> and IM and you&#8217;ve got a distraction free environment to work in. Notifications <strong>can</strong> be a big problem, although I didn&#8217;t realise how much of a distraction they were to me. I&#8217;ve now turned off new mail notifications, and I&#8217;m certainly noticing the difference in increased productivity.</p>


	<p>Finally we&#8217;ve got an option that&#8217;s Linux exclusive. For all the Compiz users out there we have yet another option as well &#8211; <span class="caps">ADD</span> Helper. When enabled<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> you can use the <strong>super+p</strong> combination to make everything except the panels and the current window dim and transparent. Everything is still there, just not in your face and so hopefully not distracting you.</p>


<hr />

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Ubuntu users you need to install the settings manager:</p>


<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
</pre>

	<p>You can then access it via System &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced Desktop Effects Settings</p>
