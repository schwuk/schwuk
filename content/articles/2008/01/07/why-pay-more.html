<p>A couple of years ago my mother bought us a dedicated photo printer &#8211; a <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Printers/Direct_Photo/Selphy_DS810/index.asp">Canon <span class="caps">SELPHY DS810</span></a>. It&#8217;s a nice enough printer, and it does exactly what it says on the tin (i.e. print photos). Being able to connect it directly to my camera or just use memory cards can be so convenient. I&#8217;ve even printed via IR from my phone before, which leads me to&#8230;</p>


	<p>The other day I wanted to print a photo from my <span class="caps">N95</span>, which manages to support every function under the sun except IR printing. In all fairness it is a 5 Megapixel camera, so the image would be a bit large (and therefore slow) for IR, but still. The <span class="caps">N95</span> does support Bluetooth printing, but Canon only supports their <span class="caps">BU20</span> Bluetooth module which retails for upwards of £40, and I&#8217;ve never cared enough to get one. Fortunately the <span class="caps">N95</span> also supports <span class="caps">USB</span> printing, so my immediate problem was solved.</p>


	<p>When I ordered my <span class="caps">N95</span> (and <span class="caps">N800</span>) I realised I&#8217;d misplaced my Bluetooth dongle so I promptly ordered another one off eBay for less than £4 delivered (and then just as promptly found my other one). It arrived this morning and on a whim I plugged it into the <span class="caps">DS810</span> &#8211; lo and behold, it worked. I&#8217;m sure my other dongle never worked (although I just tried it, and it seemed to), but I had let myself be brainwashed by Canon into believing that only their (overpriced) offering would work and didn&#8217;t bother to research alternatives.</p>


	<p>Lesson learned.</p>
