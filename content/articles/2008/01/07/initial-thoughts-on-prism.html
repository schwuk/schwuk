<p><a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/">Prism</a> &#8211; from Mozilla &#8211; tries to integrate web applications with your  desktop by giving you an icon and dedicated browser window for each application you configure. That&#8217;s it.</p>


	<p>I saw Prism when it was first announced, but never got around to looking at it. Then a <a href="http://www.ossgeeks.co.uk/?p=185">recent post</a> by Lee Tambiah reminded me about it and I actually got around to looking at it just now.</p>


	<p>Installation is simple:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Download the tarball from <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~mfinkle/prism/">here</a></li>
		<li>Extract it to a folder in your home directory (e.g. /home/you/prism)</li>
		<li>Then for each site you want to &#8220;applicationise&#8221;, run /home/you/prism/prism and give it a <span class="caps">URL</span> and name, check the options and ask it to create a desktop icon</li>
		<li>When you want to re-open the application, double-click the relevant icon on your desktop</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Nice and simple, eh?</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s not really a lot else to say. It&#8217;s Gecko based, so it will work as well as Firefox. There&#8217;s no tabs, Extensions or Flash &#8211; I&#8217;ll let you decide if that&#8217;s good or bad.</p>


	<p>For sites like <a href="http://twitter.com/schwuk">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://pownce.com/schwuk/">Pownce</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> (and at a pinch, <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>) it&#8217;s great, but without tabs I couldn&#8217;t imagine using it for <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Reader</a>, or <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a>.</p>
