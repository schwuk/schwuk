    <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/">Prism</a> &#8211; from
    Mozilla &#8211; tries to integrate web applications with your desktop by
    giving you an icon and dedicated browser window for each application you
    configure. That&#8217;s it.
</p>

<p>
    I saw Prism when it was first announced, but never got around to looking at
    it. Then a <a href="http://www.ossgeeks.co.uk/?p=185">recent post</a> by Lee
    Tambiah reminded me about it and I actually got around to looking at it just
    now.
</p>

<p>Installation is simple:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Download the tarball from
        <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~mfinkle/prism/">here</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Extract it to a folder in your home directory (e.g. /home/you/prism)
    </li>
    <li>
        Then for each site you want to &#8220;applicationise&#8221;, run
        /home/you/prism/prism and give it a <span class="caps">URL</span> and
        name, check the options and ask it to create a desktop icon
    </li>
    <li>
        When you want to re-open the application, double-click the relevant icon
        on your desktop
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Nice and simple, eh?</p>

<p>
    There&#8217;s not really a lot else to say. It&#8217;s Gecko based, so it
    will work as well as Firefox. There&#8217;s no tabs, Extensions or Flash
    &#8211; I&#8217;ll let you decide if that&#8217;s good or bad.
</p>

<p>
    For sites like <a href="http://twitter.com/schwuk">Twitter</a>,
    <a href="http://pownce.com/schwuk/">Pownce</a> or
    <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> (and at a
    pinch, <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>) it&#8217;s great, but
    without tabs I couldn&#8217;t imagine using it for
    <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Reader</a>, or
    <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a>.
