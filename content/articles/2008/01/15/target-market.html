	<p>It would seem my assumptions about the target market for this site are a bit off.</p>


	<p>I skim through my report from <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> every day or so to observe traffic, but I had a bit of a closer look today and noticed something interesting: <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> is the most popular browser to view this site.</strong></p>


	<p>Here are some of the more pertinent figures:</p>

            <!--more-->

            <h4><span class="caps">MPB</span> (Most Popular Browser)</h4>


	<p>Considering the typical content I post here, I would have assumed that Firefox would have been by far the most popular browser. How wrong could I be? Safari and Konquerer rule the roost, while Firefox and Internet Explorer share the bottom rung.</p>


	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>1.</td>
			<td>Safari</td>
			<td>45.66%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2.</td>
			<td>Konqueror</td>
			<td>36.99%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3.</td>
			<td>Opera</td>
			<td>16.18%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4.</td>
			<td>Firefox</td>
			<td>0.58%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5.</td>
			<td>Internet Explorer</td>
			<td>0.58%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>




	<h4>Operating Systems</h4>


	<p>This one is more reassuring &#8211; Linux is only just behind Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows is lagging behind both of them. I was surprised to see iPod (presumably Touch) and iPhone making an appearance though.</p>


	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>1.</td>
			<td>Macintosh</td>
			<td>42.77%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2.</td>
			<td>Linux</td>
			<td>41.62%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3.</td>
			<td>Windows</td>
			<td>10.98%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4.</td>
			<td>Unknown</td>
			<td>2.31%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5.</td>
			<td>iPod</td>
			<td>1.73%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>6.</td>
			<td>iPhone</td>
			<td>0.58%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>




	<h4>...and there&#8217;s more</h4>


	<p>It appears widescreen is popular these days with 1280&#215;800 being used by a quarter of my visitors and 1440&#215;900 by &sim;15%. Unsurprisingly 24-bit colour is the most popular by far.</p>


	<p>&sim;85% of visitors read a single page and move on.</p>


	<h4>Not A Metric</h4>


	<p>All these figures are obviously skewed for two reasons:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Most people &#8220;consume&#8221; this site through a feed reader or one of the Planets I&#8217;m syndicated to, so I never get to see (or count) them</li>
		<li>Google Analytics requires JavaScript which is not universal</li>
	</ol>


	<h4>85.7% of statistics are made up</h4>


	<p>I switched to Google Analytics when they first opened it up, but prior to that I used a local package (AWStats I think) for reporting on my server logs. I think I may re-enable them &#8211; or try something else, suggestions are welcome &#8211; to get a better view of my traffic.</p>


	<p>In a future post I&#8217;ll do the ever popular &#8220;search keywords&#8221; summary.</p>
