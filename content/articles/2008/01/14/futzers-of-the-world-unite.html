		<p>Hi. My name&#8217;s Dave and I&#8217;m a Futzer.</p>

	<p>Compulsive browsing &#8211; or as I prefer to it, learning &#8211; has a new name: <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2008/01/12/futzing-as-the-future-of-work/">Futzing</a> (which I discovered via <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/01/14/future-job-title-master-futzer/">Web Worker Daily</a>. Defined by Tara Hunt as:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>the process by which one wanders around without aim, having conversations (with new and old friends), gathering random information, learning ostensibly useless knowledge and avoiding all tasks/duties clear and present.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Of course the only other <a href="http://www.pluk-in.com/sound/glossary.html">definition</a> I can find is:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>a sound as if it is coming over the telephone or radio</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...so I&#8217;m happy to accept Tara&#8217;s one.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been futzing for years. I use the internet to constantly learn, although I don&#8217;t always realise the value of that learning until later on. Invariably though, what I have learnt always comes in useful.</p>
