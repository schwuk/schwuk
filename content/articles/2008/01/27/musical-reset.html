<p>A post from Ryan Singer of 37signals about <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/788-how-to-take-control-of-a-massive-itunes-music-library">how to take control of a massive iTunes library</a> got me thinking about my own music collection. Obviously I&#8217;m not using iTunes, but according to <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/">Rhythmbox</a> my music collection isn&#8217;t small. Right now it claims I have 2,884 songs taking up 14.3GB of space which would provide me with 7 days, 19 hours and 14 minutes of non-stop, non-repetitive (barring duplicates) music. I&#8217;m sure there are lots of people who can (and will) boast of larger music collections, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned that&#8217;s a lot of music. This, coupled with the fact that my Top Rated and Recently Played automatic playlists encompass only a fraction of my collection inspires me to do something about it.</p>


	<p>Initially I was going to follow Ryan&#8217;s approach &#8211; archive off all the music and only add it back into my collection when I had a real desire to listen to it &#8211; but after mulling the idea over for a few days I&#8217;ve decided to take an additional step: instead of simply rebuilding my collection from, er, my collection, I&#8217;m going to actively <strong>seek out new music</strong>.</p>


	<p>My collection is wide and varied, but I do tend to listen to the same stuff over and over again. Now I&#8217;m going to enlist the likes of , <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/">Jamendo</a>, and <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> to discover something new. I&#8217;m also going to try and tune into a few more musical podcasts like <a href="http://www.djsteveboy.com/podrunner.html">Podrunner</a> and <a href="http://www.djsteveboy.com/groovelectric.html">Groovelectric</a> to add some variety.</p>


	<p><em>Any suggestions of artists/bands or podcasts for me?</em></p>
