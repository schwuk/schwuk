It was remiss of me not to mention it at the time, but during that traditional British pastime known as Easter Weekend I left the comfort of Cumbria and ventured south. After a completely uneventful journey (although there was KFC of the boneless variety) I found myself in the company of <a href="http://popey.com/">Alan Pope</a>, <a href="http://daviey.mooo.com/">Dave Walker</a>, <a href="http://waitingcloud.org/">Ciemon Dunville</a>, a significantly svelter (than the last time I saw him) <a href="http://tonywhitmore.co.uk/">Tony Whitmore</a>, <a href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/">Laura Cowen</a>, a bunch of audio equipment, several <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/">EeePC</a>s, an <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/products-neo-base-00-stdkit.html">Openmoko Neo 1793</a>, and cake (<a href="http://www.aperturescience.com/">no lie</a>).

Such a gathering could only mean one thing...

No, not that!

It was the recording of the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/2008/03/24/s01e02-stuck-on-you/">second episode</a> of the official (because we said so) <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> which, thanks to certain stars and planets being aligned (and the fact I was in the area anyway), I was able to take part in.

This was my third attempt at participating in a podcast - the first two involved (separately) a phone and attending the Linux User and Developer Exposition - and was very enjoyable. It took me bit to get used talking into the microphone and not at whoever I was talking/replying to, but I got there. I've met all except Ciemon numerous times in the past, so it really was more like getting together with friends than recording a show. Considering this is only their second episode, it all felt very professional.

I'd love to take part in more episodes, but geography is against that, so I'll continue to be involved in planning, promotion and the site of course.

We've added a <a href="http://twitter.com/uupc">Twitter account</a> for the show where we'll announce items of pertinence. If you're a Twitterer make sure you follow us.

Anyway, go listen, (hopefully) enjoy and more importantly <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/contact-us/">let us know</a> what you thought.
