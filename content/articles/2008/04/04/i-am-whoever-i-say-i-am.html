In contrast to
<a href="http://madduck.net/blog/2008.04.04:nicknames/">Martin</a> and
<a href="http://blog.digital-scurf.org/2008/04/04#hello-my-name-is">Daniel</a>,
I really don't care how you refer to me. My parents called me David, most people
call me Dave, in my teenage years a few friends only referred to me as Murph or
Murphy, particular ex-colleagues persist in using my childhood nickname of
Smurf, and the vast majority of people I interact with primarily through IRC
know me as Schwuk. Various other nicknames have also been used and discarded
throughout my life. Schwuk, Smurf and the rest are as much as part of my
identity as my given names, so I have no problem with others using them in real
life. One of the refreshing things about coming to
<a href="http://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> from a more traditional company
was the widespread use of IRC and the opportunity for my personal and
professional identities to merge. Then again, maybe I'm just strange. :)
