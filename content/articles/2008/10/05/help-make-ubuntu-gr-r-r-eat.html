Monday October 6th 2008 is the second <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/UbuntuTestingDay/20081006">Ubuntu Testing Day</a> where we will be focusing on testing of upgrades of 8.04 (Hardy Heron) to 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex).

<strong>What is a testing day?</strong>

The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/UbuntuTestingDay">Ubuntu Testing day</a> is a special day where the Ubuntu Community comes together with a shared goal of testing an specific set of ISO images (Alpha, Beta, RC, Gold or Point releases). Taking the idea from the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/">Ubuntu Bug Day</a>, we want to apply the same concepts to ISO testing.

<strong>Who can join in?</strong>

Everyone. You don’t need to be a developer. You don’t need to know how to code. Everyone is welcome. If you don’t know how to help, then just stop on by and we’ll explain everything to you. In fact, one of the objectives of the Testing Day is to help people willing to start testing Ubuntu to make it better.

<strong>How to join in?</strong>

Come to #ubuntu-testing on freenode IRC. We will be there all day and night helping to resolve any testing queries you might have. Normal testing activity takes place in #ubuntu-testing at other times also.

<strong>What we will be testing?</strong>

This time we will be focusing on testing distribution upgrades. If you want to upgrade your Hardy system (*buntu 8.04) to Intrepid (*buntu 8.10) this is a great way to help on your way.

Also, my colleague <a href="https://launchpad.net/~cr3">Marc Tardif</a> (cr3) will be giving a session at the #ubuntu-classroom IRC channel  at 15:00 UTC about the testing infrastructure, giving an overview on the tools available to make Ubuntu testing easier and more fun.

Please, join us tomorrow and help make Ubuntu even better!
