<strong>Baking</strong>

For the past week I've been re-discovering the joys of baking. Numerous loaves of bread have baked and eaten (it's very difficult to let warm bread go untouched), Flapjack has been enjoyed (although I need to get the quantities right - both batches have had Red Bull style effects!), and yesterday saw Schwuklet #2 and I baking a batch of 50-odd chocolate chip cookies. Currently only 1 remains...

<strong>Wooden Spoons</strong>

Earlier this year I was given a <a href="http://www.raymears.com/Bushcraft_Product/83-Crook-Knife-Right-handed/">crook knife</a> (mine happens to be a double-sided one) in exchange for a paracord watch strap. At the time I had a quick go with it and made something that <em>resembled</em> a spoon, but I wasn't really that happy with - in particular the bowl was far too...chunky.

Yesterday (prior to baking the cookies) whilst laying a fire a piece of wood caught my eye as being perfect for whittling a (slightly short) spoon. I roughed out the shape using my mora and dug out the crook knife to make the bowl, and I'm very pleased with the result. As said, the handle is quite short, so it will be more of an "eater" as opposed to a "stirrer". I need to sand and oil it, then sort out some pictures.
