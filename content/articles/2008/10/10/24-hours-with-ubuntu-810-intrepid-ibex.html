Around this time yesterday I was most of the way through upgrading my main laptop to Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex).

So far, everything seems to be working as well as if not better than before, with a couple of exceptions.

<strong>The good</strong>

Besides the obvious improvements, a couple of things stand out for me so far:

<ul>
	<li>Suspend/hibernate "just works" for me now. This always used to be a problem, but not any more</li>
	<li>I love the NewHuman theme (but see "The bad")</li>
</ul>

<strong>The bad</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Network Manager - although greatly improved - will enable both wired and wireless simultaneously (good I hear you say), but the icon only shows the wired status with no indication of the wireless signal strength. Confused the hell out of me earlier when I thought my ADSL connection was playing up, but in fact was connected to a very weak wireless connection</li>
	<li>Claws is my MUA of choice because of it's superior IMAP handling, but when combined with the NewHuman theme is unusable thanks for the pale, pale grey text on a white background in folder/message views</li>
	<li>The same text color problem afflicts Firefox, particularly when using Wordpress (like I am to write this post!)</li>

The last two correspond to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/human-theme/+bug/243957">bug #243957</a>, <del datetime="2008-10-10T11:00:48+00:00">but I haven't found (or reported) the right bug for Network Manager yet</del> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/262152">#262152</a> seems like the right candidate for my Network Manager problems.

Overall I'm more than happy with Intrepid, and have had no stability problems either.
