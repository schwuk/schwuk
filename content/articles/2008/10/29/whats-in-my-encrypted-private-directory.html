I'm not sure what <a href="http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/">Dustin</a> has done to his feed but a bunch of his old posts showed up again in Google Reader this morning. His post "<a href="http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2008/10/what-in-my-encrypted-private-directory.html">What's in my Encrypted ~/Private directory?</a>" struck a chord since I've <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/922565">only just set mine up</a>, so I thought I'd breathe some life into his idea of making it into a meme.

Here's what's in mine:

<code>
dave@treebeard:~/Private$ ls -alF

drwxr-xr-x  7 dave dave 4096 2008-10-22 20:16 .tomboy/
</code>

Just the usual culprits: documents, e-mail and anything that might have passwords/identity information in it. 

So what's in yours?
