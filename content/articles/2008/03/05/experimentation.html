A change is as good as a rest, or so they say. Well this week I've been making quite a few changes.

It started off with a post from Jorge about <a href="http://stompbox.typepad.com/blog/2008/02/launchpad-plugi.html">integrating Launchpad with GNOME Do</a>. I'd been aware of <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/">GNOME Do</a> for a while, but never got around to trying it. Well now I have, and I love it. I do have to keep reminding myself it's there, but I'm getting used to it.

A quick side note - PPAs rock. Major props to Celso, Julian and Kiko for making them part of <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a>. They make obtaining packages for new projects so much easier.

I can't remember what prompted me to try it, but I'm now using the <a href="http://wiki.awn-project.org/">Avant Window Manager</a> (also known as AWN). This combined with GNOME Do lets me have a minimalist desktop.

Following a discussion about <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a> I'm now trying that out again (see <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/10/21/flock-me">here</a> and <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/10/26/flock-ing-annoying">here</a> for my previous experiences with it). I'll post some updated opinions in a few days, but at the moment I'm ambivalent. As always when playing with a new toy, this post has been written with Flock.

Finally I'm back on <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> again thanks to <a href="http://jaikuinvites.com/">Jaiku Invites</a>. I'm not quite sure why when I'm getting <a href="http://twitter.com/schwuk/statuses/766505657">increasingly bored with social networks</a>, but we'll see what happens.

Another side note - my machine hung completely while I was originally writing this post. After the reboot both Firefox and Flock restored their sessions as I have become used to. I was also pleased to the see that Flock restored this post.
