I'm sure I'll get some heat for this, but here goes...

Why is managing media so painful under Linux?

I have a significant amount of <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2008/01/27/musical-reset">audio</a> on my laptop, and a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/12/27/late-presents">phone</a> that is a fairly capable music player. However if I want to copy some of that audio to my phone, I have to resort to manually copying and arranging the files, as well as ensuring the tags are right (as the N95 relies on these). It's an awkward, but manageable process that I don't do so often.

Podcasts are a different story though. My phone is capable of downloading podcasts itself, but they are slow to download and awkward to manage. Copying podcasts from the laptop to the phone can be fraught with peril.

By contrast I had to reset my daughter's iPod today after I tried to manage it under Linux.Â  The reset and re-population through iTunes was painless. I know it is because Apple control the software and hardware, but it can't be <strong>that</strong> hard to get right can it?

Don't even get me started on photos and movies...
