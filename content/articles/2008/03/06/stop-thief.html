I've been lucky. I've never really been a victim of theft, and when I have it has been for small amounts of money or insignificant items.

Now I have come across someone stealing the content from my <a href="http://schwuk.com">site</a> -  and anyone else who is aggregated in <a href="http://planet.ubuntu.com">Planet Ubuntu</a> - and seeking to profit from this through the use of Google Adverts.

The culprit? http://linuxindex.com

I have sent an e-mail to the domain contact asking them to cease reproducing my content without permission immediately. I have also reported the policy violation to Google AdSense. I would urge anyone else on Planet Ubuntu to do the same.
