The other day I upgraded to the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/hardy/beta">Hardy Heron beta</a>, and the experience - as expected - was mostly flawless.

I inititated the upgrade last thing at night and left it downloading. The next morning it was waiting for me to answer a question, which I did and then continued working while it proceeded in the background. It needed input from me a few times concerning configuration files, but for the most part no interaction was required. A while later it was complete and asked me to reboot. I did because it was a convenient time for me, but throughout the whole process I just carried on working with no problems at all.

I've no experience of upgrading (or even installing) OS X, but I know the same experience would be difficult to replicate on Microsoft Windows, especially when you consider that all my applications were upgraded at the same time as the Operating System.

Once Hardy is formally released - and I've got the opportunity - I plan to completely re-install this machine and wipe all traces of Microsoft Windows from it forever (Vista is still lurking around on here, wasting space along with a defunct recovery partition).

So if like me you're waiting for the release of Hardy, add the counter to your website. Find the massively complicated installation instructions <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/countdown">here</a>.
