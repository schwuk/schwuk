Version 2.5 of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> has been <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">released</a> today, and I've upgrade this site accordingly.

The upgrade was pretty painless, apart from a weird bug that happens if you're (like me) using the K2 theme. Everything works, except the admin dashboard. I've been meaning to develop my own theme anyway, so maybe this will be impetus I need to do so.
