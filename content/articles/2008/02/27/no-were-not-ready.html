"...OK, now we're ready."

This year I'm going to attempt to join the annual <a href="http://www.jedimoose.org/index.php/archives/2008/02/25/a-bit-like-painting-the-forth-road-bridge/" title="See mrBen's post about his challenge" target="_blank">LugRadio marathon</a> - initiated by mrBen (pictured below) - in the build up to <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/" title="Visit the LugRadio Live hub" target="_blank">LugRadio Live</a> (the original and best <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/" title="See details of LugRadio Live UK 2008" target="_blank">UK version</a>, unless someone wants to sponsor me to go to the <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/" title="See details of LugRadio Live USA 2008" target="_blank">USA one</a>).

I've already started with Season 1, Episode 1 "<a href="http://lugradio.org/episodes/#episode1" title="See details of LugRadio Season 1, Episode 1" target="_blank">The Phantom Message</a>". Even though they've improved in both technical and professional terms over the years, listening to that first episode again reminded me why I like(d*) listening so much. Indeed I became their first official fan!

In the spirit of competition I'm going to see mrBen's challenge and raise it by including all of <a href="http://planet.lugradio.org/hashlugradio/" title="Visit the hashlugradio site" target="_blank">hashlugradio</a> as well. This is, of course, in preparation for hashlugradio Live 2008 - the event that allows LugRadio Live to share the same time, dates and venue.

<em>* I can't remember when or exactly why I stopped listening regularly. Maybe I'll be able to spot it as I go through.</em>
