<p>A while back I was discussing <span class="caps">FOSS</span> alternatives for <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2008/1/24/cutting-out-distractions">cutting out distractions</a>, and one of the pieces of software that I  couldn&#8217;t find a decent alternative for was <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">Writeroom</a> which is commercial software for the Mac.</p>


	<p>Now <a href="http://jehaisleprintemps.net/">Bruno Bord</a> (who&#8217;s basically French) has come to the rescue with the <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/pyroom/">PyRoom</a> project. I may have to get involved.</p>
