<p>Tonight I set forth on a tour of Boston and Plymouth, MA, with a brief delay in London tomorrow morning.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be in Boston Wednesday evening through to Sunday afternoon. Thursday and Friday will be spent in the same location as <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-Boston"><span class="caps">UDS</span> Boston</a> but not actually attending. Saturday and most of Sunday I&#8217;m free to roam and the following week will be spent with fellow Canonical-ers in Plymouth.</p>


	<p>My time in Plymouth is booked pretty solid, but if anyone wants to meet up whilst I&#8217;m in London or Boston then <a href="http://schwuk.com/static/contact-details">get in touch</a>.</p>
