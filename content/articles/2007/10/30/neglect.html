<p>I&#8217;ve been a bad, bad blogger&#8230; and I apologise.</p>


	<p>Life has been <strong>really</strong> hectic recently. Lots to do at work, varying amounts of travelling, a not-so-secret project heading locomotive style towards completion, and a super-secret-but-not-so-to-certain-people project just kicking off which promises to dominate everything for the foreseeable future.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not going promise to blog everyday, but I will put more effort in maintaining both this site and my various social network presences.</p>


	<p>Expect the usual flurry of blog posts shortly, this time hopefully <strong>not</strong> followed by an extended period of silence.</p>
