	<p>Yes, that&#8217;s my handiwork. So is the tagline <strong>sworn in the <span class="caps">USA</span></strong>. I also suggested <strong>the land of the chin and home of the beard</strong>, but sworn is better.</p>


	<p>No idea if I will get to <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1004"><span class="caps">LRLUSA</span>&#8217;08</a>, or even if it will be as good as the <em>originals</em> but the simple fact that a drunken idea has managed to spawn a popular podcast, an annual event and now an international event deserves to be recognised.</p>


	<p>For the record the logo was created in <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, and if you wish to pimp <span class="caps">LRLUSA</span>&#8217;08 yourself, you can grab some images here:</p>

		<li><a href="http://schwuk.com/assets/2007/7/12/LRLUSA_200px.png">Regular</a>, 200&#215;74</li>
		<li><a href="http://schwuk.com/assets/2007/7/12/LRLUSA_100px.png">Happy meal</a>, 100&#215;37</li>
	</ul>


	<p>If you want to do some remixes &#8211; I&#8217;m sure the LugRadio boys will appreciate it &#8211; here&#8217;s the source:</p>

	<p><ins>As <a href="http://kryogenix.org">Aq.</a> rightly points out, these need to allow commercial use so that they can use them to promote <span class="caps">LRLUSA</span>&#8217;08 in good faith. Therefore I have revised the license under which they are made available (this is why Creative Commons is so good). I could have given the <span class="caps">LRL</span> guys separate permission, but this way is cleaner.</ins></p>
