<p>News is <a href="http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/20070706-00">starting</a> <a href="http://www.cypherbios.org/blog/?p=39&#38;language=en">to</a> <a href="http://jjesse.wordpress.com/2007/07/07/update-on-official-ubuntu-book/">filter</a> through<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> that the second edition of the Official Ubuntu Book has now been released<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>

	<p>Although my work has been <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/04/25/published">published</a> before, this is the first time I&#8217;ve been credited as an author. It is a pretty exciting experience! Writing the book was fun and I learned a lot, both about writing <em>and</em> <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, whilst doing it. I do have some other projects still in the pipeline, but I hoping there will be a third edition&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve now received my complimentary copies.</p>

<hr />

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I know I&#8217;m playing catchup, but I was <a href="http://lugradio.org/live">busy</a> at the weekend!</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> There seems to be some disparity in the publication dates given by Prentice Hall, Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk, but some of the other authors have got their copies so if it&#8217;s not out yet it certainly will be soon.</p>
