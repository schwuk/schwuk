<p>After <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/6/25/social-networking-sites">announcing</a> which social networking sites I was using, I&#8217;ve now dropped two: MySpace and Twitter.</p>


	<p>Both sites I joined on a whim &#8211; I only personally knew one or two people on each, and I&#8217;ve not invested much time in growing my networks on either. I thought about it and came to the conclusion that a) I wasn&#8217;t exploring the potential of either, but more importantly b) I had no interest in doing so.</p>


	<h3>MySpace</h3>


	<p>Although I enjoy music, I don&#8217;t feel the need to have the bands I listen to as &#8216;friends&#8217;. I feel it far more worthwhile to indicate my appreciation for a particular artist by actually, you know, <strong>listening</strong> to them so <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> is a far better fit for this.</p>


	<p>In addition, with only one or two exceptions none of my real friends can be found on there so it&#8217;s use for actual networking is pretty limited.</p>


	<h3>Twitter</h3>


	<p>I liked the idea, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly why I signed up. Whatever goals they had in mind, I&#8217;ve only found it to be a poor mans Instant Messenger. I found a few twitters actually interesting (and in one case  even profitable) but the vast majority fell into the categories of:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Interesting links &#8211; usually TinyURL&#8217;d due to the character limit which makes you less likely to click. If I find a link interesting, I&#8217;ll put it on <a href="http://del.icio.us/schwuk">del.icio.us</a>, not spam my IM contacts with it!</li>
		<li>Blog posts &#8211; again TinyURL-ified. Again there is much better solution for this &#8211; it&#8217;s called feeds</li>
		<li>Half of a conversation one of your &#8216;friends&#8217; is having with someone not on your list</li>
	</ul>


	<p>I think the problem here is that Twitter is push-based, whilst I prefer to choose what I want to consume and more importantly how.</p>


	<p>Certain features were cool, like being able to &#8216;twitter&#8217; from my mobile (at no cost).</p>


	<h3>Delete, not discard</h3>


	<p>I could have simply stopped using both services, but I decided to take the step of actually deleting my accounts. If I find I miss them or I discover a compelling reason to use them then I may re-create them. Until then, I&#8217;ve got two less distractions to worry about.</p>
