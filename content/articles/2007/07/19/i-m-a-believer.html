    I currently have 59 feeds in my <span class="caps">OPML</span> file. 4 of
    those are planet feeds with <em>x</em> number of feeds each, so the total is
    easily over 100. If I don&#8217;t catch up with my feeds every day or so, I
    soon get overwhelmed and end up marking a batch as read without even looking
    at them. To make sure I wasn&#8217;t letting them pile up I was reading them
    far too many times a day.

    Many, many places covered how
    <a href="http://scobleizer.com/http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a> reads over
    600

        >feeds a <strong>day</strong></a
    >, and I ignored it at first. Then more sites covered it, and I started
    thinking about my own feed reading habits and decided to follow
    Hackzine&#8217;s advice:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use Google Reader (keyboard commands make browsing faster)</li>
    <li>
        Use &#8220;all items view&#8221; to see the full river of news in
        chronological order
    </li>
    <li>
        Filter out potentials in the first pass. Take a top level filter for
        topic, information density, author, and quality of post. Only articles
        that make the cut are looked at in more detail.
    </li>
    <li>Superhuman abilities help</li>
</ul>

<p>
    OK so I didn&#8217;t start wearing my underpants on the outside to satisfy
    the last one, but the rest did help. Instead of reading my feeds in their
    categories with the list view (and using a mouse!), viewing all items in the
    expanded view and relying on the keyboard makes getting through my feeds a
    breeze. I now set aside a block of time a day to catch up on feeds and have
    them done in record time.
</p>

<p>
    One tip not covered by Scoble is the use of starring, or rather how I use
    them. Instead of following links whilst I&#8217;m reading, I star an item I
    want to follow up on and come back to them later (remembering to remove the
    star when I&#8217;m done. If the feed item is just a stub to the real thing,
    I&#8217;ll open it in a new tab in the background (yay Firefox!) and move
    on, only moving away from Google Reader when I&#8217;m done.
</p>

<p>
    The other tip I picked up from Scoble is to
    <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/15901845567661786341"
        >share items</a
    >, which works really well when combined with the
    <a
        href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=e0e7bb035cf823292dcbba9586adb3d9"
        >Google Reader Shared Items</a
    >
    Facebook app.
