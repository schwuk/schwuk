    After
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/7/9/trimming-the-fat">dropping</a>
    a couple of social networks, then being
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/7/10/poncing-about">invited</a>
    I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of thinking, mainly about the value in
    &#8216;broadcast&#8217; mechanisms like Twitter and <del>Ponce</del> Pownce.
    This train of thought lead me into a chat with
    the-man-that-needs-no-microphone
    <a href="http://www.loudmouthman.com/">Nik Butler</a>, who is a big fan of
    social networking (both on- and off-line).
</p>

<p>
    As these sorts of chats are want to do, we did stray quite far from the
    topic of social networks, but as well as putting the world to rights he did
    make me appreciate some of the benefits that can be gained from putting the
    effort into using these sites. This, coupled with the realisation at several
    points through the day that there were things that I would like to
    broadcast, but didn&#8217;t warrant a full post here has led me to
    <a href="http://twitter.com/schwuk">re-register</a> with Twitter.
</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;m hesitant to commit to too many networks though &#8211; having to
    maintain a status in Facebook, Jaiku, Twitter and <del>Ponce</del> Pownce is
    straining. Ideally I&#8217;d like to be able to edit one (or any) of them
    and have the others reflect that. I use <del>Gaim</del> Pidgin because I
    want my IM in one place<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup
    >. I use a feed reader so that I don&#8217;t have to go to different places
    to get content. How long before there is combined client for social
    networks?
</p>

<p>
    Although I have U-turned with Twitter I stand by my decision to drop
    MySpace, although my decision had nothing to with
    <a
        href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/06/24/viewing_america.html"
        >class</a
    >. Quite simply it had almost no value for me in return for maintaining.

    <a href="http://skype.com">application</a> to be able to have the chat with
    Nik.
