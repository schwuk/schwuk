<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/7/9/trimming-the-fat">dropped</a> two social networking sites from my collection. In a &#8220;everything happens for a reason&#8221; way I received an invite to <a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> this morning, which I accepted without really thinking about it.</p>


	<p>A minor digression &#8211; I get that you can&#8217;t launch a new brand these days without savaging the English language, and I also get that they&#8217;re trying to do a play on the word pounce but no matter how hard I try I keep reading and pronouncing it as &#8216;ponce&#8217; which is:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>A British slang term for a dandy, fop or pimp</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...which, for me, ruins the branding.</p>


	<p>First impressions matter. In the few hours I&#8217;ve been registered <del>Ponce</del> Pownce has been down more than it has been up &#8211; or at least every time I&#8217;ve tried to access it. I managed to get registered and add the one person I knew who used it, but that is it.</p>


	<p>...which for me, ruins the experience.</p>


	<p>Seeing as I couldn&#8217;t actually use it, and I didn&#8217;t really understand (I did say I accepted the invite without thinking) what problem they were trying to solve &#8211; apart from taking on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> &#8211; I started doing some research. Tony Hung has <a href="http://www.deepjiveinterests.com/2007/07/09/pownce-is-not-twitter-nor-is-it-as-important-as-twitter/">summarised</a> my findings quite succinctly, which reminded me of why I signed up for Twitter in the first place &#8211; being able to, er, twitter from my phone or IM.</p>


	<p>This, to me, is far more valuable than the prettiest site design in the world. Until <del>Ponce</del> Pownce (or Jaiku) offer <strong>both</strong> these methods then they&#8217;re lagging behind. Sure it would be great if Twitter had sets, and being able to add events and files to Pownce is a nice feature (although events are better served by something like upcoming or meetup). Of these, sets is the only killer feature over Twitter and that&#8217;s ruined by being forced to use the website (or their &#8216;desktop&#8217; client which I can&#8217;t use since Adobe&#8217;s interpretation of cross platform is as bad as Microsoft&#8217;s).</p>
