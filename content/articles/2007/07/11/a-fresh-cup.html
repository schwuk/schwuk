<p>Last night, thanks to <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/7/10/chewing-the-fat">Twitter</a>, I got to renew a acquaintance with Mike Gunderloy (I was a big fan of his books <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2004/9/28/book-review-coder-to-developer">Coder To Developer</a> and <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/1/31/book-review-developer-to-designer">Developer To Designer</a>). I used to follow his <a href="http://larkware.com/">Daily Grind</a> blog as it was widely regarded as <strong>the</strong> source for Microsoft Windows related development news, but as my interest in the topic waned I dropped it from my regular reading.</p>


	<p>Fast forward to yesterday when Mike added me as a friend in <a href="http://twitter.com/schwuk">Twitter</a>, I discovered his new (to me) site <a href="http://afreshcup.com/">A Fresh Cup</a> which both charts his transition to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> (and an Apple platform) and serves as a Rails version of the Daily Grind.</p>


	<p>Mike&#8217;s tale is very interesting to me, especially having made the transition myself (albeit to Python, but I went via Rails and intend to revisit it soon), and I think it might inspire some others too. For obvious reasons I&#8217;d like to have seen Mike move to Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution for that matter) but, as I was discussing with Josette (from O&#8217;Reilly) and <a href="http://www.tonywhitmore.co.uk/blog/">Tony</a> (whilst convincing him to get a <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Rails book</a>) at the weekend, Rails and Macs still seem to go hand-in-hand so Mike&#8217;s choice was a natural one.</p>


	<p>Oh, and Mike is using the same platform for his new site as I use here &#8211; <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a>.</p>
