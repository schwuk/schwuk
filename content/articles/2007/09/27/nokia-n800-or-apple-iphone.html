<p>Earlier this week I was in New York City (it&#8217;s a helluva town), and as well as the usual tourist attractions I stopped by the Apple store in Soho so I could play with the iPhone and iPod Touch.</p>


	<p>Both devices are very slick &#8211; Safari and WiFi access are excellent &#8211; but I see little point in getting a Touch when the iPhone is just around the corner in the UK. Even better, the iPhone is exclusive to my current mobile provider.</p>


	<p>However, I have a slight dilemma. I like Apple products, and I really want an iPhone when my contract is up for renewal. The problem is that I don&#8217;t like the direction Apple is going with shutting out direct access to their devices, nor can I properly sync my Evolution calendar and contacts to the device if I get one. Thirdly, I already have a phone that is pretty good (as a phone).</p>


	<p>So I started focusing  about what I really like about the iPhone, and apart from the whole shiny Apple experience it boils down to two things: Browser and WiFi. This got me thinking again about the Nokia <span class="caps">N800</span>, which also has the added bonuses of being a) open, b) hackable and c) supports VoIP.</p>


	<p>What I really want to know from <span class="caps">N800</span> owners is two things:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Are you happy with your device?</li>
		<li>Are you planning to replace it with an iPhone?</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Answers on a postcard please.</p>
