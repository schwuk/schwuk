<p>My laptop contains &#8211; amongst other things &#8211; a <a href="http://www.amd.com/gb-uk/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_13909,00.html">dual-core <span class="caps">AMD</span> Turion&trade; 64 X2</a> which is unsurprisingly a 64-bit processor. When I purchased the machine and shoved Vista to the side to install Ubuntu I opted for the 32-bit version because, well, basically I&#8217;m lazy.</p>


	<p>One upgrade, multiple updates, and various package installs/removals later and I think things are starting to get a bit crufty. Combining this with my growing resentment of Vista hogging a part of the hard disk that I rarely use, and I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s time to re-install and do it properly this time.</p>


	<p>This leaves me with one question though &#8211; should I go 64-bit or not? I&#8217;ve heard various stories with varying degrees of horror and wonder, and I just don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s worth it or not.</p>
