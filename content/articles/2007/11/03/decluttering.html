<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of autumn cleaning. I&#8217;ve dropped some feeds, some friends from Facebook and Pownce, and I&#8217;m dropping Twitter and Jaiku entirely (if they&#8217;ll ever let me delete the account without erroring).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m keeping Pownce, even though I don&#8217;t really use it. We&#8217;ll see in time if I change my mind.</p>
