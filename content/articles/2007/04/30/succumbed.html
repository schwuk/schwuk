    Casa de Schwuk gained a new occupant over the weekend &#8211; an Xbox 360. I

    getting one for the longest time &#8211; mainly due to a lack of decent
    titles at launch &#8211; but as time has gone on my resolve has crumbled.
</p>

<p>
    Thanks to Amazon &#8211; great price, great deal on games I
    <strong>actually</strong> wanted, and delivered in under 24 hours! (ordered
    before lunch on Friday, on my doorstep 07:30 on Saturday) &#8211; I&#8217;m
    back playing on Live again.
</p>

<p>
    For &pound;10(!) Amazon gave me
    <a href="http://crackdownoncrime.com/">Crackdown</a> (great fun),
    <a href="http://gearsofwar.com/">Gears of War</a> (beautiful, but
    haven&#8217;t cracked online play yet) and
    <a href="http://www.prey.com/">Prey</a> (still in its wrapping, may find
    it&#8217;s way onto eBay), and
    <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legostarwarsii/"
        ><span class="caps">LEGO</span> Star Wars II</a
    >
    was purchased for schwuklet #2.

    If anyone out there is on Live and wants to play against me, here&#8217;s my
    gamer card.
