<p>It&#8217;s finally here!</p>


	<p>Today marks the last day of my employment with <a href="http://csc.com"><span class="caps">CSC</span></a>. After 9 years (originally a freelancer, then the last 4&frac12; years as a permanent employee) it is time to move to pastures new.</p>


	<p>On Monday I will be joining <a href="http://canonical.com">Canonical</a> as a developer on <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> (any comments about (open|free)ing of said product should be directed to <a href="http://understated.co.uk">Matt</a>).</p>


	<p>The best bit? Getting to work with a passionate group of people who believe in what they&#8217;re doing. The worst bit? Having to explain to non-technical family and friends what Canonical do. The best bit of the worst bit? Starting to explain it to the schwuklets, realising who I&#8217;m talking to, tell them they help make <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> and schwuklet #2 (who is only 5 years old) knowing <em>exactly</em> what I&#8217;m talking about! :)</p>


	<p>Of course every silver lining has a <a href="http://jonobacon.org">cloud</a>, but you have to take the (dog) rough with the smooth. (I&#8217;d put a ;) in here, but you know how much he <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=787">likes</a> those&#8230;)</p>
