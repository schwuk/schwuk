<p>
    Once upon a time there was a little project called the
    <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=520"
        ><span class="caps">XAMPP</span> Control Panel</a
    >. An associate of mine had a hankering for a similar application to control
    specific services used for web development on his local machine, so I looked
    to adapt Jono&#8217;s project to his needs. However, as is often the case in
    these scenarios, I ended up scrapping the vast majority of his code and
    starting from near-scratch.
</p>

<p>
    In a very short space of time a working result was achieved, but said
    associate no longer had a requirement for due to a change of platform.
    Rather than let it languish, I started adapting it to be more generic and
    removed some additional (and not fully implemented) functionality to create
    the <strong>WebDev Control Panel</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    A project which promptly vanished into the depths of my hard disk and was
    mostly forgotten about. I fetched it out from time-to-time and tweaked a bit
    here, changed a bit there, but overall it sat collecting dust. I fully
    intended it to be released as Free software, but was loath to release in its
    current form.
</p>

<p>
    Jumping forward to a couple of weeks ago, I needed to re-acquaint myself
    with Python, so I dusted off the project and started polishing it. I made
    the code more object-oriented; I converted it from a fixed list of services
    to a dynamic one (controlled by a config file); and finally I made it ready
    for translation.
</p>

<p>
    Finally the time had come, and I could find no decent reason for putting it
    off any longer. I had to release it.
</p>

<p>
    So, after that long introduction, here is the
    <a href="http://launchpad.net/wdcp">WebDev Control Panel</a>. Enjoy.
