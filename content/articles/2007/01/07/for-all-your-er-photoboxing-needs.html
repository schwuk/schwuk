<p>Christmas is a time of giving, and in one particular case of my family it was a time of someone giving a mousemat printed with a photo of the recipient to someone else. It was also a time of me being roped in to arrange said gift.</p>


	<p>After looking into a few options, I recalled a <a href="http://townx.org/blog/elliot/photobox">post</a> by my friend Elliot about <a href="http://photobox.co.uk/">Photobox</a> and how he recommended them.</p>


	<p>Long story short, I&#8217;m adding my recommendation to Elliot&#8217;s, and I&#8217;ll be using them again in the future.</p>
