<p>Last time it was the turn of the <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/1/9/tree-identification-silver-birch">Silver Birch</a>, this time it is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HooUO-PkG0Q">mighty</a> <a href="http://www.british-trees.com/guide/scotspine.htm">Scots Pine</a> &#8211; (Pinus sylvestris which means &#8220;pine of the woods&#8221;). I have a few of these in my garden.</p>

	<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta">coniferous</a> tree also common throughout the UK and native to northern Europe &#8211; in fact it is the only native British Pine. Its needles grow in pairs up to 8cm long and are slightly twisted.</p>

	<p>Pine wood burns well, although it has a tendency to spit. Due to its high levels of resin it makes excellent kindling. Its wood is also commonly used for all manner of wood products.</p>


	<p>The needles of a Pine tree make an excellent tea, which contains plenty of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C">vitamin C</a>. Pine trees can also be consumed in various other ways as <a href="http://www.ruralvermont.com/vermontweathervane/issues/winter/97012/eatpine.shtml">described</a> by Euell Gibbons in an excerpt from his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stalking-Healthful-Herbs-Euell-Gibbons/dp/0911469060">Stalking The Healthful Herbs</a>.</p>
