<p>Elliot <a href="http://townx.org/blog/elliot/rails_shared_hosting_application_error">bemoans</a> the fact that hosting a Ruby on Rails application on shared or virtual hosting is too hard, and I can attest to this.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned the issues I&#8217;ve had with Typo many times, and although Mephisto is better the box is still working much harder than it should be. Rails may be a great framework for development, but hosting the results is different story all together.</p>


	<p>Like Elliot I also have a couple of internal applications that run quite happily, but they are running on dedicated (albeit low-end) boxes &#8211; just like the <a href="http://37signals.com">big boys</a> do. I suspect that both of these would fail if I tried to move them to shared or virtual hosting.</p>
