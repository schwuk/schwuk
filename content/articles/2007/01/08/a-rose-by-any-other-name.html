<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushcraft">Bushcraft</a> is a loaded term these days. Mention bushcraft to a non-practitioner and their most likely reaction will be &#8220;You mean like that bloke <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Mears">Ray Mears</a>?&#8221; and while Ray has done a huge amount to raise public awareness of bushcraft, he is by no means the first or the only person to practice it. Mention it to a practitoner, their reaction will most likely either be one of hero worship for Mr Mears or a dismissal of the term in favour of one that sounds different but means the same,</p>


	<p>Bushcraft. Woodcraft. Woodmans skills. Indigenous skills. Primitive living. There are lots of names for the same things, but they all boil down to the same thing &#8211; getting closer to nature &#8211; but bushcraft currently has the most recognition.</p>


	<p>And so I introduce the new section on my site &#8211; <a href="http://schwuk.com/bushcraft">Bushcraft</a> &#8211; in which I will file anything related to the outdoors..</p>
