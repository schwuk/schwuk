<p>It&#8217;s always best to tackle things in small pieces. It makes hard jobs simpler, and learning difficult subjects easier. As part of my efforts to improve my outdoor skills I decided to work on my tree identification skills which are currently, to be fair, pretty rubbish. Instead of spending hours swotting up I going to take a different approach.</p>


	<p>Fortunately my garden has a quite a number of trees, with a fair number of different species. I&#8217;m going to take one tree at a time, identify it, research it and publish what I here along with some pictures. Following this process should help lock what I&#8217;ve learnt in my head and in time build up to a decent collection. I don&#8217;t intend to write either the authoritative or even a complete work on tree recognition, but if what I write helps others then that is an added bonus. I&#8217;m starting this effort now as I want to be able to identify the trees in both winter and summer. Once I&#8217;m done with my garden then I&#8217;ll move further afield.</p>


	<p>First of all is the <a href="http://www.british-trees.com/guide/silverbirch.htm">Silver Birch</a> (Betula Pendula) &#8211; a stalwart of bushcraft and an easy identification. I thought I had a few of these in the garden but on closer inspection I have only one.</p>

	<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous">deciduous</a> tree common throughout the UK. Easily distinguished by its triangular (or more accurately rounded kite) shaped, serrated edged leaves and distinctive white/grey bark.</p>

	<p><em>I&#8217;ll post a photo of the leaves when they come out. I know I could source an image from somewhere else,  but that defeats the object somewhat.</em></p>


	<p>In winter the hairless twigs have alternating buds and may have catkins &#8211;  especially towards spring. <em>On my example below the catkins are quite obvious, possibly as a result of the ridiculously mild minter we are having.</em></p>

	<p>Birch wood burns quickly but gives out good heat and pleasant smell.</p>


	<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic">diuretic</a> can be concocted from the leaves, and in the spring the tree can tapped and sap extracted from the tree (although care must be taken not to &#8216;bleed&#8217; the tree dry) which can be fermented into wine, drank neat, or &#8211; as recommended by Ray Mears &#8211; frozen into ice cubes and served with a good single malt.</p>


	<p>See the bottom of <a href="http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/lady.htm">this</a> page for recipes for both the tea and wine.</p>


	<p>The bark of a Silver Birch tree is extremely useful. It can be peeled off the tree like paper (do not take bark in a full circle around the tree though &#8211; this will &#8216;girdle&#8217; the tree and eventually kill it) and is waterproof. Due to its flexibility it can be used to make a variety of objects from small containers right up to Canoes! The bark is also a wonderful aid to fire lighting and is amongst the best of the natural tinders.</p>
