    fades into the annals of the interweb, our attention is turned to the
    <a href="http://www.british-trees.com/guide/beech.htm">Beech</a> &#8211;
    (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em> &#8211; meaning &#8220;Beech of forests&#8221;,
    imaginative lot these latin speakers&#8230;). I have a large number of these
    in my garden, with the majority former a border between my garden and the
    rest of my land.

    The Beech is a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous">deciduous</a> tree, and a
    native of the British Isles. It can grow up to 40 metres (that&#8217;s over
    130 feet) tall, although the large examples are in decline due to a
    combination of lowering water tables causing die back in some and high winds
    felling others.
</p>

<p>
    Its twigs have alternating shoots, with long slender buds growing out from
    the twig. It&#8217;s leaves are glossy green on the top, and have plain
    edges.

<p>Beech trees often keep their leaves long after others have fallen.</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ll update with a photo of the leaves later in the year.</em></p>

<p>
    Beech bark is typically gray and smooth, and retains this appearance
    throughout the life of the tree.

<p>
    Beech wood burns well when seasoned. Green Beech wood will burn, but not as
    well. As well as being a good firewood and for producing charcoal, the
    timber is used for furniture &#8211; although usually used for smaller
    components &#8211; and flooring.
</p>

<p>
    Apparently the leaves make a &#8220;fine salad vegetable&#8221;, but they
    are better eaten in Spring than later in the year.
</p>

<p>
    Beech nuts, best gathered in Autumn, are edible although tedious to peel.
    The kernels can roasted and ground to make a coffee substitute, or pressed
    to extract oil which can be used for salad dressings or cooking. Sawdust can
    be boiled, baked, mixed with flour and made into bread.
