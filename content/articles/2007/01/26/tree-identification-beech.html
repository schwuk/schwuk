<p><em>I&#8217;d like to dedicate this post to <a href="http://rimron.co.uk/">Xalior</a> since I know how much he is enjoying this series.</em> :P</p>


	<p><ins>I got this one <a href=".">wrong</a> The photos have been replaced with ones of an actual Beech, whilst you can find the original photos correctly identified as a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/2/6/tree-identification-black-poplar">Black Poplar</a>.</ins></p>


	<p>As the (mighty) <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/1/16/tree-identification-scots-pine">Scots Pine</a> fades into the annals of the interweb, our attention is turned to the <a href="http://www.british-trees.com/guide/beech.htm">Beech</a> &#8211; (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em> &#8211; meaning &#8220;Beech of forests&#8221;, imaginative lot these latin speakers&#8230;). I have a large number of these in my garden, with the majority former a border between my garden and the rest of my land.</p>

	<p>The Beech is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous">deciduous</a> tree, and a native of the British Isles. It can grow up to 40 metres (that&#8217;s over 130 feet) tall, although the large examples are in decline due to a combination of lowering water tables causing die back in some and high winds felling others.</p>


	<p>Its twigs have alternating shoots, with long slender buds growing out from the twig. It&#8217;s leaves are glossy green on the top, and have plain edges.</p>

	<p>Beech trees often keep their leaves long after others have fallen.</p>


	<p><em>I&#8217;ll update with a photo of the leaves later in the year.</em></p>


	<p>Beech bark is typically gray and smooth, and retains this appearance throughout the life of the tree.</p>

	<p>Beech wood burns well when seasoned. Green Beech wood will burn, but not as well. As well as being a good firewood and for producing charcoal, the timber is used for furniture &#8211; although usually used for smaller components &#8211; and flooring.</p>


	<p>Apparently the leaves make a &#8220;fine salad vegetable&#8221;, but they are better eaten in Spring than later in the year.</p>


	<p>Beech nuts, best gathered in Autumn, are edible although tedious to peel. The kernels can roasted and ground to make a coffee substitute, or pressed to extract oil which can be used for salad dressings or cooking. Sawdust can be boiled, baked, mixed with flour and made into bread.</p>
