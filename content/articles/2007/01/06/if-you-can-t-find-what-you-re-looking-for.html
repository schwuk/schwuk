<p>...please ask a member of staff.</p>


	<p>Although much better, my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/1/1/reborn">switch to Mephisto</a> was not without its casualties. This can mainly be seen in three areas:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Design. I was using Scribbish before because I couldn&#8217;t be bothered migrating my old design to a newer version of Typo. I&#8217;m now using the default Mephisto theme, but this will be transformed into a new take of my old design &#8220;real soon now&#8221;. Honest.</li>
		<li>Sections (or categories or whatever). The migration script copied everything over but these. Not sure why&#8230; Anyway it was time for shakeup. I&#8217;ve recreated the important sections and filed recent (hah!) posts. Older posts are not filed. Maybe if I get bored one day&#8230; Per-section feeds (for various planets) will be re-instated when I update the design.</li>
		<li>Links. Links to old posts may or may not work (hopefully they will). If you can&#8217;t find what looking for, search!</li>
	</ol>
