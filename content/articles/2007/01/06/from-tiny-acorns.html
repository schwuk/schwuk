<p>I&#8217;ve been quiet. Too quiet. Even allowing for the holidays I&#8217;ve been too quiet. However, in my defense, there are reasons for this.</p>


	<p>Firstly, following on from my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/9/27/published-again">previous</a> <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2006/12/8/radical-python">articles</a> there will be more, in a Python vein.</p>


	<p>Secondly, a couple of projects &#8211; which at the moment I won&#8217;t discuss, not because I can&#8217;t, just because I like being mysterious &#8211; will be coming to fruition this year. Think articles, but <span class="caps">BIGGER</span>. ;)</p>


	<p>We shall have to wait and see if they turn into Oaks!</p>
