<p>Out with the old, in with the not-so-new.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been a long-term user of <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>. I loved being able to access my feeds from any computer, including my <span class="caps">PDA</span>. The <span class="caps">PDA</span> is no more, I got annoyed that you couldn&#8217;t read individual articles, and after stumbling across <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a> I switched. I switched because I could read individual articles, and I was now only using one computer on a regular basis.</p>


	<p>I didn&#8217;t run into any glaring issues with Liferea, but because I make heavy use of tabs in Firefox I never became comfortable with having my feed reader outside my browser.</p>


	<p>The news that <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> now <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/feed-your-television.html">supported</a> the Wii Internet Channel piqued my curiosity and I decided to sample their wares once again.</p>


	<p>So far I am liking it &#8211; they&#8217;ve improved the interface since I tried it last. I&#8217;ve not tried it through the Wii, nor from my mobile, but it is nice to know the functionality is there if I want it.</p>


	<p>OK, so it is not really any different to using Bloglines but at this point I&#8217;ll refer you back to the title of this entry&#8230;</p>
