<p>Out with the old, in with the not-so-new.</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;ve been a long-term user of
    <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>. I loved being able to access
    my feeds from any computer, including my <span class="caps">PDA</span>. The
    <span class="caps">PDA</span> is no more, I got annoyed that you
    couldn&#8217;t read individual articles, and after stumbling across
    <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a> I switched. I switched
    because I could read individual articles, and I was now only using one
    computer on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
    I didn&#8217;t run into any glaring issues with Liferea, but because I make
    heavy use of tabs in Firefox I never became comfortable with having my feed
    reader outside my browser.

<p>
    The news that <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> now

    the Wii Internet Channel piqued my curiosity and I decided to sample their
    wares once again.
</p>

<p>
    So far I am liking it &#8211; they&#8217;ve improved the interface since I
    tried it last. I&#8217;ve not tried it through the Wii, nor from my mobile,
    but it is nice to know the functionality is there if I want it.
</p>

<p>
    OK, so it is not really any different to using Bloglines but at this point
    I&#8217;ll refer you back to the title of this entry&#8230;
