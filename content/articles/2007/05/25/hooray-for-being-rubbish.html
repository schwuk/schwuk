<p>I&#8217;m well known for being absent-minded, disorganised and focused-to-the-point-of-excluding-external-stimuli, and the combination of these things have and will continue to cause conflict.</p>


	<p>A prime example of this is <a href="http://lugradio.org.live">LugRadio Live</a>. I was going, I was a crew member, it was planned. Then another event came up that I couldn&#8217;t refuse so I had to forego <span class="caps">LRL</span>.</p>


	<p>Now thanks to my inherent rubbishness it turns out that the other event is on a weekend with similar dates, but they&#8217;re in June rather than July!</p>


	<p>So I can now proudly display my crew badge, for I <em>shall</em> go the ball!</p>

	<p><em>Yes, I know &#8211; if I hadn&#8217;t been rubbish in the first place I&#8217;d have got the dates right and the conflict would never had existed. Don&#8217;t spoil the moment for me.</em></p>
