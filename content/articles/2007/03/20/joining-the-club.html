<p>Groucho Marx once said:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I don&#8217;t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>In this case, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll take the same stance! Tonight I was accepted as an <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers">Ubuntu member</a>.</p>


	<p>Many thanks go to popey, LoudMouthMan, and mrevell for their support and to sabdfl, mako and elmo for voting me in.</p>
