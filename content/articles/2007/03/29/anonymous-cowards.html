<p>Communities &#8211; by definition &#8211; are made up of different people, who will act differently even though they have a common interest. However when the actions of one reflect on the community as a whole, they need to be called out.</p>


	<p>Within the Ubuntu community we have the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> to define acceptable behaviour, and &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; the community is better for it. Recently there was a &#8216;<a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-uk/2007-March/003698.html">joke</a>&#8217; posted to the <a href="http://ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu-UK</a> mailing list, which one member <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-uk/2007-March/003718.html">responded to</a> describing it as breaching the Code of Conduct. Unfortunately Caroline did not explain her reasoning, but nonetheless a <del>minor flame war</del> heated discussion was triggered.</p>


	<p>Jump forward a good few days, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_Coward">some anonymous coward</a> &#8211; who presumably was involved in the aforementioned discussion &#8211; decided to <a href="http://secretlondon.livejournal.com/158846.html?thread=269438#t269438">target</a> Caroline for swearing on <strong>her</strong> blog. Following this she has <a href="http://secretlondon.livejournal.com/159101.html">removed</a> herself from both the planet and mailing list.</p>


	<p>The departure of <strong>any</strong> member from a community should be reflected on. In this case I don&#8217;t blame Caroline for leaving as she was not made to feel particularly welcome recently, but I hope she will reconsider her position. The actions of this one anonymous coward however are inexcusable, and by remaining anonymous make the rest of Ubuntu-UK look bad.</p>
