    Although I&#8217;m a big <em>consumer</em> of digital media, I&#8217;ve
    never really been much of a <em>purchaser</em>. Apart from a few exceptions
    (which I&#8217;ll come to) the vast majority of my media is either a) ripped
    from physical media, b) shared with friends or c) free. The latter
    encompasses things like YouTube and podcasts, or stuff from the like of
    <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/">Jamendo</a> or
    <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The few pieces of media I&#8217;ve purchased have been exclusively through
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> because
    <strong>they make the whole damn process so easy</strong>. The trouble is
    that now my house is mostly<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> free of
    <em>that</em> operating system I can no longer use iTunes to purchase any
    new music (or even listen to/watch the stuff I have purchased &#8211;
    <span class="caps">DRM</span>
    <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/">sucks</a>). So I&#8217;ve avoided
    purchasing anything new <em>digitally</em> since then.
</p>

<p>
    Yesterday I was introduced to a couple of new bands:
    <a href="http://www.floodofred.com/">Flood of Red</a> and
    <a href="http://www.entershikari.com/">Enter Shikari</a>. I&#8217;m always
    keen to support artists I like, but I don&#8217;t really buy CDs anymore.
    However Enter Shikari&#8217;s site linked me to
    <a href="http://www.7digital.com/">7digital</a> who had both bands and
    &#8211; even better &#8211; they were available as unencumbered
    <span class="caps">MP3</span> (as well as the more typical
    <span class="caps">WMA</span> and <span class="caps">AAC</span>) so I
    grabbed both Flood&#8217;s EP and Enter&#8217;s album as well as
    <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com/">The White Stripes</a> latest (Icky
    Thump) in said format. Checkout was painless as they support PayPal (so I
    don&#8217;t have to give my card details to yet another company), and my
    only criticism of the whole process was that I had to download each track
    separately. If I was using another <span class="caps">OS I</span> could have
    used their software to speed this up but it was only an inconvenience, not a
    show stopper.
</p>

<p>
    So I&#8217;ve got new music, almost instantaneous satisfaction, and a warm
    fuzzy feeling from knowing that I&#8217;m supporting the artists (and their
    labels, and the distributors etc.) whilst not supporting
    <span class="caps">DRM</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Another criticism &#8211; but this is not 7digital&#8217;s fault &#8211; is
    that not all music is available in a choice of formats or unencumbered by
    <span class="caps">DRM</span>, but the simple fact is I won&#8217;t be
    buying anything that has those restrictions.

    <sup>1</sup> My laptop came with Vista on it, and it&#8217;s still in there
    somewhere but never gets booted. One of these days I&#8217;ll get around to
    getting rid of it.
