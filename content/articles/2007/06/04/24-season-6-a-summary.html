<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29">24</a> season 6 ended last night on Sky with a double bill, and having been a faithful follower of the series since the beginning I&#8217;d wax lyrical on my feelings about this most recent season.</p>


	<p>Meh.</p>


	<p>I <em>really</em> hope season 7 is better, but that&#8217;s what I said about this season as well so I&#8217;m not really that hopeful.</p>
