<p>OK, so <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin</a> uses the title <strong>Inbox Zero</strong>, but I prefer the term <em>process to empty</em>. This productivity tip has been floating around for quite a while and most productivity geeks &#8211; especially <span class="caps">GTD</span> aficionados &#8211; should be familiar with it. The video of his <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/2007/07/26/google-inbox-zero/">talk</a> at Google has stirred up new interest in it though, so I thought &#8211; as a practitioner of this approach &#8211; I would do my bit to pimp his talk.</p>


	<p>Enjoy.</p>
