<p>
    I&#8217;ve been a fan of mind mapping for a few years now, and prior to my
    ditching Microsoft Windows in favour of Ubuntu as my daily platform (a move
    which was only possible due to a change of job)
    <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/us/products/mindmanager_pro7/index.php?s=1"
        >MindManager</a
    >
    was generally the second application I opened after my e-mail client.
</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;ve never found a <span class="caps">FOSS</span> mind mapping client
    I like though, so although I&#8217;m much happier using
    <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> on a day-to-day basis I no longer use
    mind maps. I&#8217;ve tried
    <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"
        >Freemind</a
    >
    numerous times, but it never worked quite the way I wanted it to.
    Aesthetically
    <a href="http://www.insilmaril.de/vym/">View Your Mind</a> doesn&#8217;t do
    it for me either. Today I stumbled across
    <a href="http://www.thebrain.com/#-47">PersonalBrain</a> which has some nice
    features (and free &#8211; little &#8216;f&#8217; &#8211; version), but
    again it doesn&#8217;t compare to MindManager.
</p>

<p>
    I think it&#8217;s an integration thing &#8211; MindManager looked and acted
    like a Windows application, and integrated with Microsoft Office. Now
    I&#8217;m using <span class="caps">GNOME</span> but Freemind and
    PersonalBrain use Java whilst View Your Mind is QT based.
</p>

<p>Close, but no cigar.</p>

<p>
    However finding PersonalBrain re-kindled my interest in mind maps, and being
    a good social network citizen I looked for a relevant Facebook group. I
    found &#8211; and joined &#8211; one, and this group has led me to
    <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">MindMeister</a> &#8211; an online mind
    mapping application. Now although I dabble with online productivity
    applications, I tend to prefer desktop based ones for a few reasons:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Desktop integration</li>
    <li>Control of data</li>
    <li>Offline use</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Being practical though desktop integration is still hit and miss on Linux,
    whilst offline use is hardly required anymore &#8211; I do use my laptop
    offline, but connectivity is so easy to come by these days. That only leaves
    control of data, which remains a valid argument. However comprises must
    sometimes be made, and I think this may be one of those times.
