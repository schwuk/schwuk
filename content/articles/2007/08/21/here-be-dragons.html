<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of mind mapping for a few years now, and prior to my ditching Microsoft Windows in favour of Ubuntu as my daily platform (a move which was only possible due to a change of job) <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/us/products/mindmanager_pro7/index.php?s=1">MindManager</a> was generally the second application I opened after my e-mail client.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve never found a <span class="caps">FOSS</span> mind mapping client I like though, so although I&#8217;m much happier using <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> on a day-to-day basis I no longer use mind maps. I&#8217;ve tried <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Freemind</a> numerous times, but it never worked quite the way I wanted it to. Aesthetically <a href="http://www.insilmaril.de/vym/">View Your Mind</a> doesn&#8217;t do it for me either. Today I stumbled across <a href="http://www.thebrain.com/#-47">PersonalBrain</a> which has some nice features (and free &#8211; little &#8216;f&#8217; &#8211; version), but again it doesn&#8217;t compare to MindManager.</p>


	<p>I think it&#8217;s an integration thing &#8211; MindManager looked and acted like a Windows application, and integrated with Microsoft Office. Now I&#8217;m using <span class="caps">GNOME</span> but Freemind and PersonalBrain use Java whilst View Your Mind is QT based.</p>


	<p>Close, but no cigar.</p>


	<p>However finding PersonalBrain re-kindled my interest in mind maps, and being a good social network citizen I looked for a relevant Facebook group. I found &#8211; and joined &#8211; one, and this group has led me to <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">MindMeister</a> &#8211; an online mind mapping application. Now although I dabble with online productivity applications, I tend to prefer desktop based ones for a few reasons:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Desktop integration</li>
		<li>Control of data</li>
		<li>Offline use</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Being practical though desktop integration is still hit and miss on Linux, whilst offline use is hardly required anymore &#8211; I do use my laptop offline, but connectivity is so easy to come by these days. That only leaves control of data, which remains a valid argument. However comprises must sometimes be made, and I think this may be one of those times.</p>
