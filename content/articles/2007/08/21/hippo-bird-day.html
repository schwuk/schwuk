<p>It&#8217;s that time of year of again.</p>


	<p>I have no problem with getting older, but I really don&#8217;t feel any older than I did yesterday or even this time last year. I remember looking forward to birthday&#8217;s so much when I was young (to the point I couldn&#8217;t sleep the night before), and the feeling of being a <strong>whole year older</strong> was fantastic, but they really do count for less as you got older.</p>


	<p>Of course my friends and remembered, but I really did keep forgetting about it until yesterday. Even  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/p/David_Murphy/646869881">Facebook</a> greeted me this morning!</p>
