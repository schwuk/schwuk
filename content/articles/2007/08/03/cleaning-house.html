<p>I&#8217;m trying to be more organised (and by extension more productive). As well as the obvious things like task management (I&#8217;m not yet back into full <span class="caps">GTD</span> mode, but I&#8217;m working toward it), I&#8217;m also trying to be <em>tidier</em>.</p>


	<p>This is manifesting itself in two ways. Firstly my office is a dumping ground for anything and everything, and apart from the path from the door to my chair, and my immediate work area you cannot see the floor or any flat surface. I&#8217;ve got a huge amount to sort, but I&#8217;m taking those steps.</p>


	<p>Secondly I&#8217;m looking to eliminate online &#8216;clutter&#8217;. The other day I dropped my Jaiku account as it was worthless to me. Pownce may be next. Inspired by <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/08/01/how-to-simplify-your-online-life/">advice</a> from Web Worker Daily I made an effort to reduce my number of inboxes. If it doesn&#8217;t fit into e-mail, IM, <span class="caps">RSS</span> or Facebook I&#8217;m not paying attention to it anymore. Twitter fits into this as I can get updates through <span class="caps">RSS</span>, and thanks to their new functionality I&#8217;m only notified about certain peoples &#8216;tweets&#8217; through IM. Twitter also fits nicely into Facebook.</p>


	<p>Having increased my <span class="caps">RSS</span> load, <a href="http://mike.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns">this</a><img src="FBABF8E542F5D5DB" alt="" />9123.entry prompted me to reduce. It made me realise that of my hundreds of unread feeds, and significant proportion were things like Slashdot, Lifehacker and a bunch of gaming sites from the people at Joystiq. More often than not, I&#8217;d end up marking them all as read without looking at them. Well no more! I&#8217;ve not scrapped every feed that has &#8216;staff&#8217;, but I&#8217;ve removed quite a few of them.</p>


	<p>Which brings me to a final request. Dear lazyweb, who&#8217;s feed should I be watching that I&#8217;m not already?</p>
