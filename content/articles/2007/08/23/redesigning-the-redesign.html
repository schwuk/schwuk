<p>All change at schwuk.com, but I&#8217;m not satisfied yet!</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>I finally got sick of the default <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> theme and decided to do something about it. I was going to re-implement my old theme<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, but I decided to try something new. I fished around for some inspiration, and instead found something that appealed straight away &#8211; <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3559">Zenlike</a> which was created by <a href="http://www.nodethirtythree.com/">nodethreethirty</a>. I&#8217;ve tweaked a few bits like removing the background image, changing the header image and adding a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a> microformat to the footer. I&#8217;ve not yet completed the re-design, as I&#8217;ve now got the design bug again and want to create something of my own.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve also run into a number of frustrations with Mephisto whilst making the changes, not least of which is the lack of pagination <em>anywhere</em>! I don&#8217;t know if I can be bothered undergoing another blog engine migration, but I am considering it. Liquid layouts are good but not perfect.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web Developer</a> extension for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>, but I really came to love <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> whilst trying to debug layout problems.</p>


<hr />

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Which was written for <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> then ported to <a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo</a> before I switched to the hugely popular <a href="http://www.quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish[2">Scribbish</a>], before I moved my blog over to Mephisto and was too lazy to update the theme &#8211; after all, everyone reads blogs through feed readers these days don&#8217;t they?</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Which I&#8217;ve just discovered has been ported to Mephisto!</p>
