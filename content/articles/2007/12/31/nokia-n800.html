<p>After a rather late (or more accurately early) night, I was awoken by a text from my friend asking when my Nokia <span class="caps">N800</span> was arriving. I forewent answering him in favour of more sleep, only to be woken again, but this time by a delivery man with the item in question.</p>


	<p>After upgrading it to <span class="caps">OS2008</span> (thanks mrben), I started playing with it properly. So far I&#8217;m loving it, but I&#8217;ve not done <em>that</em> much with it besides surfing, mail and Skype but then it is an internet tablet.</p>


	<p>Things I would like to see:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Being to synchronise contacts with my <span class="caps">N95</span> or Evolution</li>
		<li>The webcam being supported by Skype/Flash</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Are there any apps I should check out?</p>


	<p>On a semi-related note yesterday I debranded my <span class="caps">N95</span> and updated it to the latest firmware.</p>


	<p>Oh, and of course this was posted from the <span class="caps">N800</span>! :)</p>
