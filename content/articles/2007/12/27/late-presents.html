    I&#8217;ve
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/9/27/nokia-n800-or-apple-iphone"
        >deliberated</a
    >
    over whether to get iPhone in the past. On Christmas Eve I actually went
    into an o2 shop with the intention of getting one, but something stopped me
    &#8211; I suspect it was the price and overpriced (and over long) contracts.
</p>

<p>
    Yesterday my phone charger died a horrible and painful death, and although I
    could just have bought a new charger I instead rang o2 to see about an
    upgrade. Tomorrow I should have a shiny new
    <a href="http://nseries.com/nseries/index.html#l=products,n95"
        >Nokia <span class="caps">N95</span></a
    >
    complete with 8GB card to play with.
</p>

<p>
    Of course I&#8217;m not satisfied with just one new toy&#8230; My friend Mat
    told about the
    <a href="http://nseries.com/nseries/index.html#l=products,n800"
        >Nokia <span class="caps">N800</span></a
    >
    being available for &pound;149.99 on play.com before Christmas but I
    resisted. This morning I checked the site again and they were &pound;129.99,
    and I just couldn&#8217;t resist this time. I know the
    <span class="caps">N810</span> is out, but I&#8217;m not that bothered about
    a built-in keyboard (right now), I&#8217;ve got a
    <span class="caps">GPS</span> in the <span class="caps">N95</span>, and
    there&#8217;s just no comparison in price.

<p>It looks like I&#8217;ve going to be uber-connected from now on!</p>
