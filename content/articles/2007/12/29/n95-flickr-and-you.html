<p>The photo in my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/12/29/hard-copy">previous</a> post was taken with my shiny <span class="caps">N95</span>. The <span class="caps">N95</span> is capable of uploading photos to <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> (and other services), but when I tried to configure it it kept rejecting my credentials. It turns out you need to use a special one (not your normal Flickr/Yahoo! ones) which you can get by visiting their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/nokia/configure/n95/"><span class="caps">N95</span> configuration page</a>.</p>


	<p>Once I set my credentials accordingly, it all worked fine. I wonder if I&#8217;ll start using Flickr more now&#8230;</p>
