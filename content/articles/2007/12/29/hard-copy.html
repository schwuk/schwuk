Got back from swimming this morning to find a package left in the garage by the
postman. I knew it was too soon to be my <span class="caps">N800</span> (but
that didn’t stop me hoping!), so I had no idea what it was. It turned out to be
some complimentary copies of my book

    >Managing Software Development with Trac and Subversion</a
>.

Although I knew the book was out, it’s not quite real until you’re actually
holding a dead tree copy in your hands. Although I still haven’t decided whether
I want to write another or not, seeing a real copy is swaying me toward doing it
again.
