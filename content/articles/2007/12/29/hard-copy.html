Got back from swimming this morning to find a package left in the garage by the postman. I knew it was too soon to be my <span class="caps">N800</span> (but that didn’t stop me hoping!), so I had no idea what it was. It turned out to be some complimentary copies of my book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/managing-software-development-with-trac-and-subversion">Managing Software Development with Trac and Subversion</a>.

<a title="My Book! by schwuk, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/schwuk/2146410414/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2146410414_df5e148890_m.jpg" alt="My Book!" width="180" height="240" /></a>

Although I knew the book was out, it’s not quite real until you’re actually holding a dead tree copy in your hands. Although I still haven’t decided whether I want to write another or not, seeing a real copy is swaying me toward doing it again.
