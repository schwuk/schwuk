<p>I&#8217;m currently trying to upgrade a machine using an Ubuntu CD. This is normally pretty painless &#8211; stick the CD in, follow the prompts and away you go. Unfortunately I chose the wrong option and cancelled the upgrade, and couldn&#8217;t get it to restart again.</p>


	<p>After a bit of head scratching I figured it out:</p>


<pre>
<code>
$ sudo sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade
</code>
</pre>

	<p>You need to specify the full path, otherwise the process fails.</p>
