<p>Apart from the <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/2/16/keeping-quiet-reason-1">obvious exception</a> most of my recent reading and book purchases have been &#8211; probably unsurprisingly &#8211; <a href="http://schwuk.com/bushcraft">bushcraft</a> related. The following are books I have recently bought or been given.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Bushcraft-Raymond-Mears/dp/0340829710/">Essential Bushcraft</a> &#8211; One of the quintessential bushcraft titles. Whilst I&#8217;m not in the &#8220;Ray = god&#8221; camp, I do like this book but it is not my favourite. My copy was signed by the man himself when I met him at a book signing. Although not a recent purchase, it has to be included in any bushcraft collection</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1551051222/203-7349351-4120705">Bushcraft</a> aka Northern Bushcraft &#8211; another &#8216;bushcraft bible&#8217; and my current favourite. More practical than Essential, and more selective. Mors eschews covering every possible aspect of the subjects covered in favour of more detail</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904263321/203-7349351-4120705">Native British Trees</a> &#8211; A lovely book that does exactly what it says. Small enough to fit in your pocket when out and about</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tree-Your-Pocket-Jacqueline-Paterson/dp/0722537786/">A Tree In Your Pocket</a> &#8211; Another pocket sized book. This one is more concerned with the folklore and mythology surrounding trees</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scouting-Boys-Handbook-Instruction-Citizenship/dp/0192802461">Scouting For Boys</a> &#8211; I don&#8217;t think this one needs any explanation, does it!</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Woodcraft-Nessmuk/dp/0486211452/">Woodcraft</a> &#8211; Another classic. Some practical tips, but mainly just an interesting read</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dangerous-Book-Boys-Conn-Iggulden/dp/0007232748">The Dangerous Book For Boys</a> &#8211; Whilst not exactly bushcraft, a fun book nonetheless that dips its toes into numerous subjects. I&#8217;ve also used it to plan activities for my Scouts</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.mlte.org/content.php?nID=53&#38;pID=15">Mountain &amp; Leadership</a> &#8211; An inspired gift from a from a friend who had no idea that achieving the <a href="http://www.mlte.org/content.php?nID=29"><span class="caps">MLA</span></a> has been on my want-to-do list for quite some time. An excellent book that covers all aspects of being outdoors</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.gransfors.com/htm_eng/yxboken/index.html">The Axe Book</a> &#8211; This comes with all Gränsfors Bruks axes, but they will also send it to you for free. Contains some useful tips.</li>
