<p>
    Apart from the

        >obvious exception</a
    >
    most of my recent reading and book purchases have been &#8211; probably
    unsurprisingly &#8211;
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/bushcraft">bushcraft</a> related. The following
    are books I have recently bought or been given.

<ul>
    <li>
        <a
            href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Bushcraft-Raymond-Mears/dp/0340829710/"
            >Essential Bushcraft</a
        >
        &#8211; One of the quintessential bushcraft titles. Whilst I&#8217;m not
        in the &#8220;Ray = god&#8221; camp, I do like this book but it is not
        my favourite. My copy was signed by the man himself when I met him at a
        book signing. Although not a recent purchase, it has to be included in
        any bushcraft collection
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1551051222/203-7349351-4120705"
            >Bushcraft</a
        >
        aka Northern Bushcraft &#8211; another &#8216;bushcraft bible&#8217; and
        my current favourite. More practical than Essential, and more selective.
        Mors eschews covering every possible aspect of the subjects covered in
        favour of more detail

            href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904263321/203-7349351-4120705"
            >Native British Trees</a
        >
        &#8211; A lovely book that does exactly what it says. Small enough to
        fit in your pocket when out and about
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tree-Your-Pocket-Jacqueline-Paterson/dp/0722537786/"
            >A Tree In Your Pocket</a
        >
        &#8211; Another pocket sized book. This one is more concerned with the
        folklore and mythology surrounding trees

        <a
            href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scouting-Boys-Handbook-Instruction-Citizenship/dp/0192802461"
            >Scouting For Boys</a
        >
        &#8211; I don&#8217;t think this one needs any explanation, does it!
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Woodcraft-Nessmuk/dp/0486211452/"
            >Woodcraft</a
        >
        &#8211; Another classic. Some practical tips, but mainly just an
        interesting read

        >
        &#8211; Whilst not exactly bushcraft, a fun book nonetheless that dips
        its toes into numerous subjects. I&#8217;ve also used it to plan
        activities for my Scouts

        &#8211; An inspired gift from a from a friend who had no idea that
        achieving the

        has been on my want-to-do list for quite some time. An excellent book
        that covers all aspects of being outdoors

        >
        &#8211; This comes with all Gr√§nsfors Bruks axes, but they will also
        send it to you for free. Contains some useful tips.
