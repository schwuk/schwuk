    I like learning and practising new knots &#8211; a few even end up being
    used in real life. A while ago I stumbled across a paracord bracelet someone
    had made. The idea intrigued me.
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracord">Paracord</a> is useful
    stuff, and I normally have some with or near me, so having a (highly
    unfashionable) bracelet made of the stuff seemed a nice idea. An idea that
    promptly sank to the back of my mind and was forgotten until today. I
    don&#8217;t know what prompted me, but I googled for instructions and came
    up with some, grabbed some paracord and gave it a try.

<p>This is made up of approximately 3 metres of paracord.</p>

    The knot used produces a nice weave, and isn&#8217;t too difficult to get to
    grips with. A very satisfying yet easy and quick little project.
