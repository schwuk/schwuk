<p>I like learning and practising new knots &#8211; a few even end up being used in real life. A while ago I stumbled across a paracord bracelet someone had made. The idea intrigued me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracord">Paracord</a> is useful stuff, and I normally have some with or near me, so having a (highly unfashionable) bracelet made of the stuff seemed a nice idea. An idea that promptly sank to the back of my mind and was forgotten until today. I don&#8217;t know what prompted me, but I googled for instructions and came up with some, grabbed some paracord and gave it a try.</p>

	<p>This is made up of approximately 3 metres of paracord.</p>

	<p>The knot used produces a nice weave, and isn&#8217;t too difficult to get to grips with. A very satisfying yet easy and quick little project.</p>


	<p><del>I could link to the instructions, but I&#8217;m going to write up my own anyway.</del></p>
