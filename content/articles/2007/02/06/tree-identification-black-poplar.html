<p><em>I originally identified this tree as a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/1/26/tree-identification-beech">Beech</a>, but as soon as I identified a real Beech I realised my mistake. It&#8217;s taken me a while to correctly identify this one, and I hope I&#8217;ve got it right this time!</em></p>


	<p>Move over <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/1/26/tree-identification-beech">Beech</a>, it is time to meet the <a href="http://www.british-trees.com/guide/blackpoplar.htm">Black Poplar</a> &#8211; (<em>Populus nigra</em>). I have a prime example of this in my garden, although it will have to be felled soon as it is slowly succumbing to high winds.</p>

	<p>The Black Poplar is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous">deciduous</a> tree, and another native of the British Isles. It can grow up to 30 metres tall and often leans, giving it a distinctive shape.</p>


	<p>Like the Beech, its twigs have alternating buds althoough the buds are shorter and stubbier than the Beech, and they grow more in the direction of the twig rather than outwards. Towards Spring catkins will also be evident.</p>

	<p>Its bark is a mixture of grey and brown, and is thick and furrowed.</p>

fills your eyes and makes you choke.</p>

	<p>Whilst Poplar is a poor firewood, its timber is both light and tough and so used for a variety of purposes.</p>
