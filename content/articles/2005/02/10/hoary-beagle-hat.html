<p>Been playing a bit recently.</p>


	<p>Tried upgrading to Ubuntu Hoary, but broke it. :(</p>


	<p>Replaced broken Hoary with Fedora Core 3.</p>


	<p>Quickly replaced Fedora with Hoary &#8211; this time installed correctly.</p>


	<h3>Fedora Core 3</h3>


	<p>I departed the Fedora world last year when I found Ubuntu, not long after I&#8217;d upgraded to <span class="caps">FC2</span>. Then I had to spend a while configuring <span class="caps">GNOME</span> to look like <span class="caps">GNOME</span> should (i.e. not the BlueCurve style). It was nice to see <span class="caps">FC3 GNOME</span> is no longer configured this way. Unfortunately, after experiencing apt-get on Ubuntu, yum (and even apt4rpm) feel a poor substitute.</p>


	<p>Final nail in the coffin? There aren&#8217;t any &#8216;official&#8217; (either packaged by  Fedora or Ximian/Novell) Mono packages for <span class="caps">FC3</span>.</p>


	<h3>Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog</h3>


	<p><em>Note to self &#8211; using <code>dist-upgrade</code> instead of <code>upgrade</code> means that things go <strong>so</strong> much smoother&#8230;</em></p>


	<p>Hoary looks very slick. Having a few minor niggles (can&#8217;t edit signatures in Evolution, can&#8217;t synchronise appointments/task from my Palm Vx), but on the whole it&#8217;s good.</p>


	<p>It also has up-to-date Mono packages in <code>universe</code> as well.</p>


	<h3>Beagle</h3>


	<p>Inspired by <a href="http://jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=440&#38;PHPSESSID=897deac3c8d1d3726b6b33b15d1f0cda">Jono</a> I decided to install <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a>. Following the <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HoaryBeagleInstallHowto">instructions</a> worked without fault, and I&#8217;ve not had the stability issues Jono mentions either.</p>


	<p>Very impressive app &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to try Dashboard next.</p>


	<h3><span class="caps">GTK</span>#</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve also been playing with <span class="caps">GTK</span># development on Microsoft Windows via <a href="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/">Paco&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?gtks-inst4win"><span class="caps">GTK</span># Installers for .NET</a>. Although not as <em>easy</em> as Windows Forms development (mainly due to the lack of integration with the <span class="caps">IDE</span>), something about <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ seems more <em>intuitive</em>. It requires much more thought to wire things up correctly, especially if you are using Glade, but that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve not yet got <span class="caps">GTK</span># 1.9.1 running on Ubuntu, but recompiling my app worked fine, even referencing .NET compiled assemblies which had just been copied across.</p>


	<p>All-in-all, a productive few days.</p>
