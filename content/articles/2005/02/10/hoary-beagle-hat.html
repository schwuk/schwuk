<p>Been playing a bit recently.</p>

<p>Tried upgrading to Ubuntu Hoary, but broke it. :(</p>

<p>Replaced broken Hoary with Fedora Core 3.</p>

<p>Quickly replaced Fedora with Hoary &#8211; this time installed correctly.</p>

<h3>Fedora Core 3</h3>

<p>
    I departed the Fedora world last year when I found Ubuntu, not long after
    I&#8217;d upgraded to <span class="caps">FC2</span>. Then I had to spend a
    while configuring <span class="caps">GNOME</span> to look like
    <span class="caps">GNOME</span> should (i.e. not the BlueCurve style). It
    was nice to see <span class="caps">FC3 GNOME</span> is no longer configured
    this way. Unfortunately, after experiencing apt-get on Ubuntu, yum (and even
    apt4rpm) feel a poor substitute.
</p>

<p>
    Final nail in the coffin? There aren&#8217;t any &#8216;official&#8217;
    (either packaged by Fedora or Ximian/Novell) Mono packages for
    <span class="caps">FC3</span>.
</p>

<h3>Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog</h3>

        >Note to self &#8211; using <code>dist-upgrade</code> instead of
        <code>upgrade</code> means that things go <strong>so</strong> much
        smoother&#8230;</em

</p>

<p>
    Hoary looks very slick. Having a few minor niggles (can&#8217;t edit
    signatures in Evolution, can&#8217;t synchronise appointments/task from my
    Palm Vx), but on the whole it&#8217;s good.
</p>

<p>It also has up-to-date Mono packages in <code>universe</code> as well.</p>

<h3>Beagle</h3>

<p>
    Inspired by
    <a
        href="http://jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=440&#38;PHPSESSID=897deac3c8d1d3726b6b33b15d1f0cda"
        >Jono</a
    >
    I decided to install
    <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a>. Following the
    <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HoaryBeagleInstallHowto"
        >instructions</a
    >
    worked without fault, and I&#8217;ve not had the stability issues Jono
    mentions either.
</p>

<p>Very impressive app &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to try Dashboard next.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">GTK</span>#</h3>

<p>
    I&#8217;ve also been playing with <span class="caps">GTK</span># development
    on Microsoft Windows via
    <a href="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/">Paco&#8217;s</a>
    <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?gtks-inst4win"
        ><span class="caps">GTK</span># Installers for .NET</a
    >. Although not as <em>easy</em> as Windows Forms development (mainly due to
    the lack of integration with the <span class="caps">IDE</span>), something
    about <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ seems more <em>intuitive</em>. It
    requires much more thought to wire things up correctly, especially if you
    are using Glade, but that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.
</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;ve not yet got <span class="caps">GTK</span># 1.9.1 running on
    Ubuntu, but recompiling my app worked fine, even referencing .NET compiled
    assemblies which had just been copied across.
</p>

<p>All-in-all, a productive few days.</p>
