<p>Been playing a bit recently.</p>


	<p>Tried upgrading to Ubuntu Hoary, but broke it. :(</p>


	<p>Replaced broken Hoary with Fedora Core 3.</p>


	<p>Quickly replaced Fedora with Hoary &#8211; this time installed correctly.</p>


	<h3>Fedora Core 3</h3>


	<p>I departed the Fedora world last year when I found Ubuntu, not long after I&#8217;d upgraded to <span class="caps">FC2</span>. Then I had to spend a while configuring <span class="caps">GNOME</span> to look like <span class="caps">GNOME</span> should (i.e. not the BlueCurve style). It was nice to see <span class="caps">FC3 GNOME</span> is no longer configured this way. Unfortunately, after experiencing apt-get on Ubuntu, yum (and even apt4rpm) feel a poor substitute.</p>


	<p>Final nail in the coffin? There aren&#8217;t any &#8216;official&#8217; (either packaged by  Fedora or Ximian/Novell)</p>
