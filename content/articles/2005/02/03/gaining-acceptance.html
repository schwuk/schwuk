<p>The other day I attended a webcast on <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032265902&#38;EventCategory=5&#38;culture=en-US&#38;CountryCode=US">Mono: Running .NET Applications on Linux</a> presented by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/"><span class="caps">MSDN</span></a>.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s right &#8211; Microsoft giving floor (or rather web) space to Mono.</p>


	<p>It was presented as part of <span class="caps">MSDN</span>&#8217;s Interop month, and the focus of the webcast was &#8211; as the title says &#8211; running .NET applications on Linux, although he did show some demos going the other way. Although I didn&#8217;t really learn anything from the webcast (nor did I expect to) it was nice to see the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mbas.html">Mono VB Compiler</a> in action. There was some coverage of using System.Windows.Forms, but it was using the old Wine-based implementation and not the newer (and far more impressive) <a href="http://svn.myrealbox.com/mwf/">Managed.Windows.Forms</a>. There&#8217;s another one coming up next week &#8211; <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032265918&#38;Culture=en-US">Mono: Interoperating with Linux the Easy Way</a>.</p>


	<p>The webcast was given by <a href="http://campus.lakeforest.edu/~hummel/">Joe Hummel</a> who I&#8217;ve since exchanged a few emails with about how the next webcast could be improved and possible future ones as well, and he seems like a nice guy.</p>


	<h3>Virtual On</h3>


	<p>During the webcast, Joe was running <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat 9</a> within <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx">Virtual <span class="caps">PC 2004</span></a>, a setup I&#8217;d created myself a few days before &#8211; although mine was running <a href="http://ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> of course.</p>


	<p>Although it does highlight the inadequacies of my current desktop, it&#8217;s a very usable solution (apart from the <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-10-07.0656256783">known</a> colour depth issue) which I&#8217;ve since expanded to included a 2nd Ubuntu install which I then upgraded to <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HoaryHedgehog">Hoary</a>. Next I&#8217;m planning on adding a <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/">Novell Linux Desktop</a> install to the collection.</p>


	<p>My virtual adventures were prompted by <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2003/11/10/923.aspx">some</a> <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/01/25/2607.aspx">posts</a> by <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter Provost</a> on developing in virtual machines. This was an idea I&#8217;d been toying with for quite a while and it&#8217;s nice to finally put it into action. Eventually I would like to replace the host OS (XP) with Linux, but it&#8217;s a matter of finding good-enough, cheap-enough (<a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/"><span class="caps">QEMU</span></a> vs. <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>) virtualisation software with the added factor of laptop support in the host OS &#8211; which of course Linux is notoriously poor for&#8230;</p>


	<p>Until then, XP &#38; <span class="caps">VPC</span> combined are enabling me to do far more than any single OS.</p>


	<h3>As seen on&#8230;</h3>


	<p>On a semi (Mono) related note, <a href="http://www.nat.org/">Nat Friedman</a> has published some <a href="http://www.nat.org/demos/">demos</a> showing Beagle and Mono in action. Very cool, and I may have a go at producing some myself based on the <a href="/entries/53">web services</a> I posted about before.</p>
