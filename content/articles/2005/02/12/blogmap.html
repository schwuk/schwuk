	<p>I&#8217;ve been doing some research into the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mappoint/products/webservice/default.mspx">MapPoint web service</a> recently, including attending a <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-US&#38;EventID=1032267566&#38;EventCategory=5">webcast</a> on the subject. The service itself looks quite impressive, but I&#8217;m not sure how the fees would stack up. For a commercial organisation, you could produce some seriously impressive integrated applications &#8211; the example from the webcast was for a claims adjuster application that would obtain the agent&#8217;s scheduled calls for the day from the company web service, then obtain directions from the MapPoint web service and display them in an AutoRoute style. Cool demo, and I can think of lots of uses for a similar application.</p>


	<p>Services like this aren&#8217;t free, and that&#8217;s a reality you have to face if you want quality of data. Although there will be &#8216;free&#8217; efforts out there (Jono <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=392">wrote</a> about <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetmap</a> a while ago but I&#8217;m not sure how they&#8217;re getting on) I can&#8217;t imagine them being able to produce the same quality of data in the foreseeable future. Mapping costs large amounts of money, and even services like MapPoint and <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> (which is a damn cool application by the way) license their maps from mapping companies.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ll just have wait and see if Google opens up and <span class="caps">API</span> for their map service, but as they&#8217;re re-distributing other peoples content rather than their own it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how they make it pay.</p>

	<p>The map shown above is generated by <a href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/">Blogmap</a>, and shows the &#8216;home&#8217; of this site. Blogmaps is (obviously) built on top of MapPoint, and demonstrates the power (and flexibility) of the service. It looks like it could be a fun service if enough people register with it, especially the &#8216;Local Blogroll&#8217; feature.</p>
