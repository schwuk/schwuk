title: "O2 XDA Exec: A brief review"

<p>Well I&#8217;ve been using my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/10/26/new-toy">new <span class="caps">XDA</span> Exec</a> for a few days now, and apart from the eternal argument about size &amp; weight (although it escapes me how it could get any smaller and still be as functional) I can honestly say that at moment (nice get out there for later posts) that I have only two complaints (apart from the also eternal requests for more speed/memory/storage/kitchen-sink-integration).</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/schwuk/57544650/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/57544650_aa0bf12f0e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="XDA Exec as a miniature laptop" /></a></p>


	<h3>What&#8217;s wrong with it then?</h3>


	<p>The most obvious defect is that when the device is closed, you have no way of knowing who is calling. You either have to answer on faith, or open it up. This is an oversight on <span class="caps">HTC</span>&#8217;s (the manufacturer of the Universal, which is branded the Exec by O2) part, and something I hope will be addressed in future designs of this type.</p>


	<p>My only other complaint is a software one: <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a> doesn&#8217;t support Bluetooth headsets. You can of course use the wired headset, but it&#8217;s still a valid annoyance (although of course this has nothing to do with the device itself which is what I&#8217;m reviewing here).</p>


	<h3>Is it really that perfect?</h3>


	<p>For me? Yes. For you? Well, that depends now doesn&#8217;t it.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve always been a <span class="caps">PDA</span> &#8220;power user&#8221;, and the Exec is definitely designed for people like me. If you primarily use your phone for talking or your <span class="caps">PDA</span> as a diary, then this isn&#8217;t the device for you. If however &#8211; like me &#8211; you want a device that keeps you connected pretty much all the time, then you really want to consider it.</p>


	<p>Although I use my phone for voice calls a fair bit, I&#8217;ve always preferred asynchronous methods of communication: email, text messages and IM (not asynchronous, but a least you can generally tell if the other party is open to contact). The Exec allows me to easily do all these, plus voice calls and web browsing from a single device. In addition it allows me to use <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a> for (much) cheaper calls anywhere I can get WiFi (and presumably 3G) coverage. Then throw in the fact that it uses a single contact list (something that&#8217;s always annoyed me about using separate devices), has all the usual <span class="caps">PDA</span> trappings (calendar, tasks etc.), and is extensible (either by off-the-shelf or homebrew software) and &#8211; for me &#8211; you have an extremely compelling device.</p>


	<h3>So, how are you using it?</h3>


	<p>In a number of ways:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>As my phone (obviously), although I&#8217;m still waiting for my number to be ported across. It does make a perfectly good phone though, and call quality (something missing from most reviews as they were pre-release kit) is above average in my opinion. Signal strength is the same as my previous phone, so I&#8217;m happy with that as well.</li>
		<li>As messaging centre. Whether it&#8217;s text (also dependent on my number being ported), e-mail, IM, <span class="caps">IRC</span> or Skype this is now my primary device for handling it.</li>
		<li>For web browsing. For obvious reasons it&#8217;s not as good as browsing on a desktop, but for things like <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> mobile and for quickly checking information (e.g. last night I wanted to do an <a href="http://imdb.com"><span class="caps">IMDB</span></a> lookup whilst watching The Day After Tomorrow<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>) it&#8217;s great.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li>For eBooks. I&#8217;ve always been a <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2004/12/14/broken-pencil">big fan of eBooks</a> &#8211; they can&#8217;t be beat for sheer portability &#8211; and I&#8217;m continuing to use them on the Exec. However because of the WiFi aspect of the Exec I&#8217;ve found myself surfing more and reading less (or at least reading my Bloglines subscriptions more).</li>
		<li>For media. At the moment I&#8217;m waiting for my 1GB SD Card to arrive, so I&#8217;m not really using it for this but it is something I fully intend to do.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>I can&#8217;t really think of anything else positive to say about it, so I&#8217;ll just reiterate how pleased I am with it. I&#8217;ll also point out that this post was composed offline in Word Mobile and posted via Pocket IE.</p>
