<p>A friend of Mrs. Schwuk wants to go wireless so her computer can go back upstairs. After looking at various options, I found a deal on eBay that was just to good to pass up for her:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.voyager.bt.com/2100/">BT Voyager 2100</a> ADSL Modem/Router/Access Point</li>
		<li>2x <a href="http://www.voyager.bt.com/1040_1060/prodinfo.htm">BT Voyager 1040</a> PCI Wireless Cards</li>
	</ul>


	<p>...for less than Â£70 including delivery.</p>


	<p>Once they arrived (the day after I paid for them &#8211; great service!), I unpacked the router and fired it up.</p>


	<p>Setup was painless: Unpack, plug in and turn on; enter your <span class="caps">ADSL</span> username and password, and you&#8217;re surfing. That&#8217;s it. Touching nothing else, I did a full <a href="https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2">Shields UP!</a> and it passed with flying colours. I then played around with some of the options and it&#8217;s a very full featured device &#8211; there&#8217;s enough there to satisfy the tinkerers amongst us, but it works extremely well out of the box.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m so enamored of it I&#8217;m considering replacing my <a href="http://www.ipcop.org/">IPCop</a> and green frog combo with one. If that&#8217;s not endorsment enough, I don&#8217;t know what is!</p>
