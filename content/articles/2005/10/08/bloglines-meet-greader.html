<p>I&#8217;ve just <a href="http://forevergeek.com/news/google_launches_reader.php">stumbled</a> across <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>. This is Google&#8217;s online <span class="caps">RSS</span> aggregator, in direct competition with <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>. As expected for any modern web application, there is a healthy helping of <span class="caps">AJAX</span> (although Google normally refer to is as plain old JavaScript).</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s a (very brief) <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/things/tour">tour</a> for the nervous/curious, but it&#8217;s just as easy to sign in with your Gmail ID (which is fast becoming the Google Passport) and start using it. I&#8217;ve already imported all my subscription from Bloglines, so I&#8217;ll see how I get on&#8230;</p>
