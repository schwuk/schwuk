<p>
    Not so long ago I
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/22/in-your-face-gmail"
        >boasted</a
    >
    about how good it was running my own solution for handling mail inc. spam
    filtering and virus scanning.
</p>

<p>It was good while it lasted&#8230;</p>

<p>
    I don&#8217;t know what has happened, but all of a sudden most obvious spam
    is reaching my inbox and virus scanning is not happening at all. The worst
    bit? I can&#8217;t figure out how to fix it.
</p>

<p>
    I am <em>this</em> far away from just forwarding all my mail through GMail
    and being done with it. I refuse to give up though!
</p>

<p>At least for a couple of hours&#8230;watch this space!</p>
