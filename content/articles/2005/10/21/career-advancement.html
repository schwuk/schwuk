<p>I know I&#8217;ve been quiet of late, but there&#8217;s a reason for that&#8230; I&#8217;ve become <span style="font-weight: bold;">management</span>! (cue ominous sounding music)<br /></p><p>I&#8217;ve been considering a change of direction at work for a while now as I&#8217;d reached the stage where I was becoming bored in my job &#8211; I knew I could easily do everything that was asked of me. I&#8217;d considered (and indeed taken steps toward) moving into project management, but before I could go too far along that track my team leader decided she&#8217;d had enough and took an extended leave-of-absence. Her role was offered to me, and I decided to take the plunge.<br /></p><p>I&#8217;ve been officially in my new role for a week now (although I&#8217;ve been doing for a week and a half as my predecessor wound down), and thoroughly enjoying it. It can be frustrating dealing with the politics, but I&#8217;m constantly occupied (which is a good thing) and learning a lot. I&#8217;m also relying on my team members a lot as there is no way I can do everything now &#8211; I suffered from an inability to delegate before mainly because I believed no-one else could do as good a job as me, but now I have no choice.<br /></p><p>Hopefully this will also give me chance to step back from focusing on the tech that I required for my job (e.g. .NET) and focus on the stuff that actually interests me &#8211; something I&#8217;ve felt a lack of recently.<br /></p>
