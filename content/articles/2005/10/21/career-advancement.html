    I know I&#8217;ve been quiet of late, but there&#8217;s a reason for
    that&#8230; I&#8217;ve become
    <span style="font-weight: bold">management</span>! (cue ominous sounding
    music)<br />
</p>
<p>
    I&#8217;ve been considering a change of direction at work for a while now as
    I&#8217;d reached the stage where I was becoming bored in my job &#8211; I
    knew I could easily do everything that was asked of me. I&#8217;d considered
    (and indeed taken steps toward) moving into project management, but before I
    could go too far along that track my team leader decided she&#8217;d had
    enough and took an extended leave-of-absence. Her role was offered to me,
    and I decided to take the plunge.<br />
</p>
<p>
    I&#8217;ve been officially in my new role for a week now (although
    I&#8217;ve been doing for a week and a half as my predecessor wound down),
    and thoroughly enjoying it. It can be frustrating dealing with the politics,
    but I&#8217;m constantly occupied (which is a good thing) and learning a
    lot. I&#8217;m also relying on my team members a lot as there is no way I
    can do everything now &#8211; I suffered from an inability to delegate
    before mainly because I believed no-one else could do as good a job as me,
    but now I have no choice.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Hopefully this will also give me chance to step back from focusing on the
    tech that I required for my job (e.g. .NET) and focus on the stuff that
    actually interests me &#8211; something I&#8217;ve felt a lack of
    recently.<br />
