<p>This is post is brought to you by the latest browser on the block: <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a>. OK, so it&#8217;s a not a new browser per se &#8211; it&#8217;s a customised version of Firefox that includes blog, del.icio.us and flickr integration, so really it&#8217;s a new browser <span style="font-style: italic;">concept</span>.<br /></p><p>So far I&#8217;ve only played with it, and had to jump through hoops to get it to support my (admitedly non-mainstream) blog engine, but I will say it looks interesting and I look forward to seeing how it develops.<br /></p>
