<p>The other day I <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/10/21/flock-me">posted</a> about the new browser <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a>. Well I&#8217;ve tried it for a few days, and I&#8217;m getting annoyed with it.</p>


	<p>Since essentially it&#8217;s just Firefox with some extensions bolted on, you&#8217;d have thought the added bits would be polished. Instead I&#8217;ve found the <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> integration a poor second to the Firefox <a href="http://delicious.mozdev.org/">extension</a>, and blogging is a chore &#8211; it produces a screwed up <span class="caps">HTML</span> post that you can&#8217;t even edit the source before it&#8217;s published, and you can&#8217;t categorise your posts at all! Of the few I&#8217;ve done via Flock, I&#8217;ve had to go into the admin side of my blog to tweak and categorise them afterwards.</p>


	<p>So ofr the time being, good old Firefox is my browser of choice again.</p>
