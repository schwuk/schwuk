<p>Whilst I&#8217;m still experimenting with some non-Debian based Linux distros (especially on the server side of things), I&#8217;ve just embarked on a couple of personal projects that <strong>require</strong> me to use Microsoft Windows as my desktop.</p>


	<p>It frustrates me as an Open Source &#38; Linux advocate how easy it is to get up and running under Windows XP compared to most distros. Although pretty much all of them are workable out of the box, most require addtional steps to get things &#8220;just right&#8221;. Ubuntu is one of the best for this, by simply enabling the universe and (optionally) multiverse repositories, as well as the additional one for &#8220;codecs of a dubious nature&#8221;. Fedora Core in contrast has a mish-mash of additional repositories, with a quite a few of them duplicating and even contradicting each other.</p>


	<p>Of course there&#8217;s nothing like these repositories for Windows, but then again <strong>it&#8217;s so much easier to find things</strong>. <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> drivers? <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp">Yep</a>. Latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader? <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Right here</a>. Media Codecs? <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">Got</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.aspx">&#8216;em</a>. Now the purists out there might complain about me linking to proprietary products <strong>but</strong> these are just some examples of tools people use everyday. For 2 out of the 4 I linked to, they are <strong>legally</strong> available for use on Linux &#8211; it&#8217;s just getting them that can be the hard part.</p>


	<h3>Look out!</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> since it was Mozilla Mail &#38; News, but I make use of e-mail, calendar and to-do lists, so having them all in one place makes more sense for me. I also have a requirement to synchronise these (and my contacts) with my Palm Vx. I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/evolution/">Evolution 2</a> under Linux, and it does an admirable job of satisfying most of what I require but it has it&#8217;s own quirks.</p>


	<p>Part of these projects entails the use of <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft Office 2003</a>, so I decided to give <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857931033.aspx">Outlook</a> a whirl since it has been a long time since I last tried it anger (Outlook 97 I think). It &#8211; like Evolution &#8211; has issues, but overall I&#8217;m pretty happy with it. Combined with <a href="http://www.chapura.com/keysuite.php">KeySuite</a> from Chapura though and it beats Evolution hands down &#8211; this is how syncing is supposed to work! I know all about the security issues with Outlook, but I run spam and virus filtering well before my mail client sees my mail (one of the advantages of running your own server) so I&#8217;m not too worried.</p>


	<h3>Too much navel gazing?</h3>


	<p>I love Linux, and I love the idea (and ideals) of Free &#38; Open Source but I always feel <strong>more productive</strong> under Windows and that&#8217;s why I feel disappointed with myself&#8230;no matter how much I want to dislike and reject Microsoft (and in particular Windows) I just can&#8217;t.</p>
