<p>I&#8217;ve just reading <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000534.html">Deconstructing Maui X-Stream</a>  which should at least win an award for it&#8217;s <strong>length</strong>.</p>


	<p>It should also win an award for a) the quality of writing and b) the quality of journalism he put into researching it.</p>


	<p>For those unaware of the whole CherryOS/PearPC debacle, this will provide more than enough information. For those that know something about it, it&#8217;s still a fantastic read.</p>
