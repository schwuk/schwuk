<p><a href="http://www.jonobacon.org">Jono</a> has <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=475">given up</a> on trying to configure <a href="http://www.imap.org/"><span class="caps">IMAP</span></a> on his server.</p>


	<p>Yesterday I spent <strong>most</strong> of the day fighting off and on with <a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a> and <a href="http://www.courier-mta.org/">Courier-IMAP</a> on my Debian server. I was trying to configure Exim for virtual domains (mapped to real users) and I followed tutorial after tutorial after tutorial, and all of the ended up with same result &#8211; no inbound mail.</p>


	<p>Eventually I gave up and switched to <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> and <a href="http://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a> &#8211; the combination I used to use under <span class="caps">FC1</span>. In less than 10 minutes I was up &#38; receiving mail <strong>correctly</strong>.</p>


	<p>I initially went with Exim and Courier mainly because they (at the least Exim) is default on Debian, and hence (supposedly) easier.</p>


	<p>Although I like Ubuntu and Debian, I&#8217;m now evaluating alternatives that should fit my needs (i.e. Mono) better. Watch this space.</p>
