<p>Well I just got back from watching Revenge of the Sith, and I can safely say that I am happy.</p>


	<p>Others can provide far better and/or in-depth reviews and commentary, but as a (pretty much) lifelong fan I am satisfied with the way that George has brought the two trilogies together. To me they will always be two trilogies (of which the first will always be the better one), and really only this latest film can be considered a true prequel. The other two &#8211; The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones &#8211; are just <em>connected</em> films to my mind. Apart from Attack of the Clones &#8216;explanation&#8217; of the clone warriors, neither really add anything to the first trilogy. Revenge of the Sith on the other hand provides a good lead-in to A New Hope, and on leaving the cinema I wanted to go straight home and watch it (all three in fact).</p>


	<p>Now we just need to wait for the numerous boxed sets to appear&#8230;</p>
