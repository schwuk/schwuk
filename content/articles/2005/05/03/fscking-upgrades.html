<p>For those of you who actually visit the site, and don&#8217;t read through your favorite aggregrator, things may look a little strange for a while. The reason is that I&#8217;ve just upgraded to the latest release candidate of <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> and it introduces some strange template bugs that weren&#8217;t there in <span class="caps">RC1</span>. I would figure out a) what&#8217;s wrong and b) how to fix them but I really can&#8217;t be bothered. They&#8217;re not that bad, and Textpattern as my blog engine is on a short lease of life now anyway.</p>


	<p>Keep your eyes peeled to see my choice of replacement&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>


	<p><ins>I&#8217;ve rolled back to <span class="caps">RC1</span> &#8211; <span class="caps">RC3</span> had too many issues, in particular the feeds weren&#8217;t working properly.</ins></p>


	<p><ins>Textpattern <strong>is</strong> still going to be replaced though.</ins></p>
