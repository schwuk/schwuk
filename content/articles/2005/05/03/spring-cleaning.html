		<p>Spring is here, a-suh-puh-ring is here.
Life is skittles and life is beer.
I think the loveliest time of the year is the spring.
I do, don&#8217;t you?  &#8216;Course you do.

	<p>OK, so spring is well on it&#8217;s way towards summer but a) <em>summer</em> cleaning doesn&#8217;t have quite the same ring to it and b) it&#8217;s not everyday I come up with a post title that (sort of) allows me to quote lyrics from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> song&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Information Overload</h3>


	<p>A quick scan of the various mailing lists I&#8217;m subscribed to shows that I&#8217;m not keeping up with them &#8211; some of them were running into <strong>hundreds</strong> of unread messages. As I rarely post/reply to the lists I&#8217;ve decided to unsubscribe from most. I did consider re-subscribing to them with my G-Mail account, but they&#8217;ll probably just end up getting unread there as well &#8211; they&#8217;ll just be easier to search.</p>


	<p>Looking at my <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/Schwuk">Bloglines account</a> shows the same problem. I&#8217;m subscribed to 63 feeds. Several of them are maxed out at 200 posts, whilst others are well on their way. Aggregate feeds like <a href="http://www.rimron.co.uk/lugradio/">Planet #lugradio</a> are going to help with this (once I drop the individual feeds), and others (like the <a href="http://codeproject.com/">Code Project</a> feeds) which I <strong>never</strong> look at will have to go as well.</p>


	<p><a href="http://del.icio.us/schwuk">del.icio.us</a> is proving useful for keeping track of sites, although I rarely re-visit them. I also received a &#8220;golden ticket&#8221; to the prelaunch of <a href="http://backpackit.com/">Backpack</a> which I&#8217;m now using to organise things as well.</p>


	<p>Basically, I&#8217;m cutting down on the information I&#8217;m <strong>ingnoring</strong> to focus on the stuff I&#8217;m not. Once I&#8217;ve gotten back into the routine of consuming information (repairing my WiFi will go along way to helping with this) I&#8217;ll start expanding my scope again.</p>
