<p>I&#8217;ve been planning to do this for a while, but I&#8217;ve just gotten around to publishing my instructions for compiling <a href="http://mono-project.com/">Mono</a> from source code.</p>


	<p>OK, so there are other <a href="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono">instructions</a>, but one of the main stumbling blocks is satisfying the various dependencies which my guide covers in detail for Ubuntu Hoary<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>Anyway, go read&#8230;</p>
