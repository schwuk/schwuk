<p>
    I was given a copy of
    <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/linuxprofessional/"
        ><span class="caps">SUSE 9</span>.3 Professional</a
    >
    by a friend who&#8217;d received it as an unwanted gift. Spurred on via
    <a
        href="http://viewfromthemountain.typepad.com/david_sobotta_weblog/2005/05/suse_93_linux_u.html"
        >the guy who prefers <span class="caps">SUSE</span> over
        <span class="caps">OS X</span> Tiger</a
    >, I mainly wanted to try it because of the
    <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download/suse-93-i586/"
        >easy availability</a
    >
    of <a href="http://mono-project.com/">Mono</a> packages for it.
</p>

<p>
    Now my machine is no speed demon &#8211; it&#8217;s a classic Athlon 800 Mhz
    with 512MB <span class="caps">RAM</span> and a
    <span class="caps">NVIDIA</span> Ti4600 graphics card
    <strong>but</strong> it runs
    <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> with
    <strong>no</strong> issues. On this machine, an Ubuntu install (with
    patches) takes between 30mins to an hour.
    <span class="caps">SUSE</span> (with patches) was pushing 2&frac12; to 3
    hours! This was about a 50/50 split install to patches (Ubuntu is probably
    more like 70/30), but the real shock was the patching process.
    <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> on Ubuntu is a split of roughly 50/50 for
    downloading and installing the patches. On
    <span class="caps">SUSE</span> this was more like 30/70 or even 20/80. I
    kept thinking it was hung!
</p>

<p>
    Once I&#8217;d got <span class="caps">SUSE</span> installed, patched and
    running, I quickly came to realise how <strong>slow</strong> it is. I
    don&#8217;t know what it was doing but booting took at least twice as long
    as Ubuntu, and it was far from responsive whilst running.
    <a

        >YaST</a

    was by far the worst culprit of this.
</p>

<p>
    Getting back to my main reason for trying
    <span class="caps">SUSE</span> &#8211; Mono &#8211; I was disappointed to
    find that it is <strong>not</strong> easy &#8211; you need a
    <strong>separate</strong> update tool. To top it all off, you can&#8217;t
    even download the tool (As linked from the Mono download page) at the
    moment.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="caps">SUSE</span> has now been wiped from my machine, and the
    media returned to its original owner to find a new home for it, and
    I&#8217;m happy, back in Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
    I am semi-tempted (being as addicted to that new distro smell as I am) to
    give &#8220;Fedora Core 3&#8221;: another whirl, seeing as there
    <strong>are</strong> now &#8216;official&#8217; Mono
    <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download/fedora-3-i386/">packages</a> for it
    (which was one of my main reasons for dissing it
    <a href="/entries/75">last time</a>).
