<p>I&#8217;m back! (for those that have missed me&#8230;)</p>


	<p>I decided to upgrade my <a href="http://linode.com/">linode</a> from a rapidly aging install of <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core 1</a> to <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/">Debian Sarge</a>. My original intention was to have a &#8216;server&#8217; installation of <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu Hoary</a>, but the upgrade from the Linode offering of Ubuntu Warty was <strong>not</strong> smooth, so I settled on Debian instead.</p>


	<p>Server config is still underway, but pretty much everything except mail and Mono is working again now.</p>
