title: Typo & Ruby on Rails

<p>It was my intention to upgrade my weblog software at the same time as my <a href="/entries/103">server upgrade</a>. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and I&#8217;m pretty impressed, <strong>but</strong> not enough to give up on <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET. My plan was to replace <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> with <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a> (which is based on RoR(Ruby on Rails)) as it provided a relatively easy upgrade path from TP, but after spending some time customising it, I decided I was changing my site to suit the app. So it&#8217;s back to the drawing board.</p>


	<p>RoR <strong>is</strong> nice, but I don&#8217;t really see a lot of extra benefit for <strong>me</strong>. I&#8217;ve also been alarmed by the reports of <a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/">Google&#8217;s Web Accelerator</a> <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast_an_alert_for_web_app_designers.php">breaking RoR apps</a>. OK, so it&#8217;s not just a RoR problem <strong>but</strong> it doesn&#8217;t inspire confidence that the people who designed RoR got caught out by it&#8230;</p>
