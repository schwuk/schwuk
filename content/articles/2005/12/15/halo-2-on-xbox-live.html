<p>Although I found <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/">Xbox Live</a> very polished on my first <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2004/12/31/xbox-live">encounter</a> with it, for various reasons I&#8217;ve not been near it since.</p>


	<p>That all changed today when my <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;item=8238287632">recently purchased</a> copy of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/h/halo2/">Halo 2</a> arrived. Now I&#8217;ve played Halo 2 (although not completed it), and I&#8217;ve played it over system link, but this was my first experience of it &#8216;Live&#8217;. Once again I impressed by the quality of the service, and I was also pleased that I didn&#8217;t get completely humiliated on the couple of quickmatches I played.</p>


	<p>I know that the Live experience is very dependent on the title in question (EA games &#8211; especially the racing games &#8211; are notoriously bad), but this was painless and enjoyable.</p>


	<p>They&#8217;ve also extended Live to include the new Gamer Card (mine&#8217;s below) which, unfortunately, you need an <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/hardware/xbox360/">Xbox 360</a> to get the full benefit from, and I don&#8217;t need to comment about how likely you are to have one of those!</p>
