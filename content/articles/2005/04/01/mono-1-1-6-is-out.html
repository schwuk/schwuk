<p>On the same day as the <a href="/entries/94">Ubuntu Hoary Release Candidate</a> came out, Mono released version 1.1.6. It&#8217;s looks like they&#8217;re holding true on their recommendation to concentrate on the 1.1 branch as there&#8217;s no corresponding release for the 1.0 branch like there usually is.</p>


	<p>Release notes are <a href="http://go-mono.com/archive/1.1.6">here</a>.</p>
