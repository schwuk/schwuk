<p>
    On the same day as the
    <a href="/entries/94">Ubuntu Hoary Release Candidate</a> came out, Mono
    released version 1.1.6. It&#8217;s looks like they&#8217;re holding true on
    their recommendation to concentrate on the 1.1 branch as there&#8217;s no
    corresponding release for the 1.0 branch like there usually is.
