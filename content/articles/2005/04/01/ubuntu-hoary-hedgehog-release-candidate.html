title: Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog Release Candidate

<p>It was <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=22981">announced</a> two days ago, and they expect to release the final version within a week! I&#8217;ve tried Hoary before, and found it quite usable then. Seeing as I recently had to dump my Warty installation (temporarily needed the space for a Windows based project) I&#8217;m in the process of downloading it at the moment and will hopefully have it installed by the end of the day. I&#8217;m also going to grab a couple of the LiveCD images to take along to my next <a href="http://cumbria.lug.org.uk"><span class="caps">LUG</span></a> meeting.</p>
