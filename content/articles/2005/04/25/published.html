<div class="image float-left"><txp:image id="22" /></div>

	<p>Like <a href="http://www.adrianbradshaw.co.uk/?p=68">others</a>, I&#8217;ve just received my complimentary copies of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596009119">Linux Desktops Hacks</a> to which I contributed hacks #49 &#38; #59.</p>


	<p>My only complaint is that my contributer blurb (page xi) says:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>David Murphy [Hacks #49 and #59] is an open source fan, and supporter of Fedora and Mono.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>C&#8217;mon &#8211; I gave up on Fedora ages ago in favour of Ubuntu! :)</p>


	<p>Nice to see my name (and work) properly in print though.</p>
