title: Took the words right out of my mouth...

<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a huge fan of his, I do have <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/">Rory</a> as one of my subscriptions in <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> because a) he can be funny (not all the time though) and b) he comes out with some good observations.</p>


	<p>Today was the latter of the two with <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/13087.aspx">his take on Python</a> which he nicely sums up with:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Because I kind of think Python sucks and is as overrated as <span class="caps">OS X</span> and Pink Floyd.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Now, this is definitely going to upset <a href="http://kryogenix.org/">some</a> just for the Python comment alone. Others are already wading in on the <span class="caps">OS X</span> and Pink Floyd comparision.</p>


	<p>Now I can&#8217;t comment on Pink Floyd as I&#8217;ve never conciously listened to any of their music, and I&#8217;ve <a href="/entries/12">commented</a> about <span class="caps">OS X</span> before so I kind of agree with that statement, but &#8211; for me &#8211;  Rory has got it <strong>dead right</strong> about Python.</p>


	<p>Not so much that it &#8220;sucks&#8221; per se, but that it is overrated and has some very strange conventions. Everyone goes on and on about how good Python is &#8211; I&#8217;ve even found myself doing it, but if I&#8217;m <em>truly</em> honest I don&#8217;t really believe it. It <em>is</em>  a nice language, it&#8217;s just not &#8220;all that&#8221;.</p>


	<p>I do do Python occasionally because I have to (i.e. maintaining existing applications) but if I&#8217;m writing something new I&#8217;ll reach for C# first time every time<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>


	<p>As foretold, Aq  has <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/03/04/pythonLike">responded</a>, so I&#8217;ll respond right back. :)</p>


	<p>Not sure where his argument about <code>self</code> vs curly brackets is going, as the latter are code blocks (i.e. indenting in Python &#8211; how&#8217;s the ink on your tab key?) whereas the former is simply wasteful. If you <strong>have</strong> to pass <code>self</code>, why isn&#8217;t done for you?</p>


	<p>Can&#8217;t comment on the 1.x/2.x and OO stuff as I don&#8217;t know enough about it.</p>


	<p>He&#8217;s right about using Python for <em>scripting</em> &#8211; it&#8217;s great for that, but then so are Perl and a whole bunch of others<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s my argument:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>A good <strong>scripting</strong> language does not make a good <strong>programming</strong> language.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Yes, you <strong>can</strong> write <em>applications</em> in Python, Perl etc. but that does mean you <strong>should</strong>. On the inverse, if you&#8217;re trying to use   say, C#, to write <em>procedural scripts</em> then you should re-evaluate your needs.</p>


	<p>As Aq says, Python is somewhere in the middle but you know what they say about &#8220;Jack of all trades&#8221;...</p>


	<h3>Conclusion</h3>


	<p>I already gave you one! OK, let me clarify and expand a bit.</p>


	<p>Firstly: Python isn&#8217;t an inherently bad language &#8211; it&#8217;s just overrated.</p>


	<p>Secondly: Use the language you want, how you want. Just use them wisely, don&#8217;t force them into situations they weren&#8217;t intended for, and (most importantly) don&#8217;t force your choices on others.</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I can&#8217;t even <em>remember</em> the last time I wrote a Perl script now, and I used to work in that on a <em>daily</em> basis.</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> I&#8217;m actually in the <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> camp for doing stuff like this these days.</p>
