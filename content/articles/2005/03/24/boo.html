<p>...did I scare you?</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;ve been aware of <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> for
    quite a while now, but I&#8217;ve not really used it. Aq&#8217;s post about
    <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/03/15/delicious">using it</a>
    prompted me to look at it again, and I&#8217;m finding myself using it a lot
    now &#8211; especially thanks to the Firefox
    <a href="http://delicious.mozdev.org/">extension</a>.
</p>

<p>
    As well as posting my own bookmarks (go on, see if you can guess my
    username) I find it useful to browse some of the tag feeds &#8211;
    I&#8217;ve got several tags and users feeds listed in
    <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Whilst browsing the
    <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/mono">Mono tag feed</a> I came across
    <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/"><span class="caps">BOO</span></a> which
    describes itself as:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Boo is a new object oriented statically typed programming language for
        the Common Language Infrastructure with a python inspired syntax and a
        special focus on language and compiler extensibility.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    It looks interesting, to say the least. Syntactially similar to
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> but designed for the
    <span class="caps">CLI</span>. Go take a look at the
    <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/BooManifesto.pdf">mainfesto</a>,
    <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Language+Features">language features</a>
    and some <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Recipes">recipes</a>.
</p>

<p>
    It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what some of my
    <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">python loving friends</a> make of the
    language. I know there is
    <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">IronPython</a>, but
    <span class="caps">BOO</span> is a new implementation &#8211; not adapting
    the old to fit the new.
</p>

<p>Another thing to add to my (never ending) to-do list!</p>
