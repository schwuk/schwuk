<p>...did I scare you?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been aware of <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> for quite a while now, but I&#8217;ve not really used it. Aq&#8217;s post about <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/03/15/delicious">using it</a> prompted me to look at it again, and I&#8217;m finding myself using it a lot now &#8211; especially thanks to the Firefox <a href="http://delicious.mozdev.org/">extension</a>.</p>


	<p>As well as posting my own bookmarks (go on, see if you can guess my username) I find it useful to browse some of the tag feeds &#8211; I&#8217;ve got several tags and users feeds listed in <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>.</p>


	<p>Whilst browsing the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/mono">Mono tag feed</a> I came across <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/"><span class="caps">BOO</span></a> which describes itself as:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Boo is a new object oriented statically typed programming language for the Common Language Infrastructure with a python inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>It looks interesting, to say the least. Syntactially similar to <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> but designed for the <span class="caps">CLI</span>. Go take a look at the <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/BooManifesto.pdf">mainfesto</a>, <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Language+Features">language features</a> and some <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Recipes">recipes</a>.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what some of my <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">python loving friends</a> make of the language. I know there is <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">IronPython</a>, but <span class="caps">BOO</span> is a new implementation &#8211; not adapting the old to fit the new.</p>


	<p>Another thing to add to my (never ending) to-do list!</p>
