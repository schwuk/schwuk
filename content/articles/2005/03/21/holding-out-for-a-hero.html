<p><a href="http://codingslave.blogspot.com/">Bob Reselman</a> (The <a href="http://www.codingslave.com/">Coding Slave</a> guy) has a post entitled <a href="http://codingslave.blogspot.com/2005/03/q-whos-new-hero.html">Who&#8217;s a new hero?</a> where he descibes Frank, the other developer at his current employer. Frank is the kind of guy who gets things done with very limited resources. He was also the only developer before Bob got there.</p>


	<h3>Remaining Objective</h3>


	<p>It&#8217;s my own fault for point the post out to him, but Aq <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/03/21/just">blames the tools and not the person wielding them</a>. Bob&#8217;s post is neither a criticism of .NET nor an endorsement of other tools &#8211; I&#8217;m disappointed Aq chose to interpret it that way.</p>


	<p>My take on this is that Bob is (probably) used to developing larger scale applications and hence much more likely to be bogged down with all the trappings that come with such projects: requirements, reviews etc. Frank is probably used to working much more loosely. If Frank chose to use .NET he may be even more productive, and if Bob designed the solution with Frank&#8217;s toolset in mind he may find his solutions simpler.</p>


	<p>Of course if you forced .NET on Frank and stopped Bob from using it the productivity of both would go down the drain.</p>
