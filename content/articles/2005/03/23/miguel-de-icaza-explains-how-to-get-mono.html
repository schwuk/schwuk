<p>Found <a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2005/03/21/interviewmiguel.html">this</a> on O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/">ONDotNet.com</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>It&#8217;s perhaps the most controversial project in the open source world, but this mostly stems from misunderstanding: Mono, the open source development platform based upon Microsoft&#8217;s .NET framework. Immediate reactions from many dubious Linux developers have ranged from confusion over its connection with .NET to wondering what the benefits of developing under it are. Throughout the course of its four years of intense development, sponsored by Novell, Mono founder Miguel de Icaza has had to frequently clarify the .NET issue and sell the community on it. In this new interview, Howard Wen asks Miguel to explain himself one more time.</p></p>
