<p>Aq. has more <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/03/21/aspnet">comments</a> on my <a href="entries/86">post</a> about Bob&#8217;s <a href="http://codingslave.blogspot.com/2005/03/q-whos-new-hero.html">hero post</a> but I still don&#8217;t think he gets it<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>It has nothing (directly) to with the tools. Large, complex applications can be written with other languages/frameworks, but inversely .NET can be used to write small, simple applications. The main thing is that .NET <strong>encourages you to write large, complex applications</strong>. All of the articles, help etc. are geared towards <em>n</em>-tier design and interoperability. Once you get into this frame of mind it can be difficult to see the wood for the trees &#8211; you&#8217;re so focused on implementing things <em>properly</em> that you forget to do it <em>simply</em>.</p>


	<p>The reason that Bob thinks Frank is a hero is <strong>not</strong> because he does wonderful things with non .NET technologies, but because <strong>he does them any technologies at all</strong>. Frank focuses on what makes makes his applications good rather than what makes an good application.</p>


	<h3>Case(s) In Point</h3>


	<p>People in the .NET world rave about <a href="http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/dottext">.Text</a> because of it&#8217;s design. When I looked at it I found it overly complex. The same is true of <a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/">FlexWiki</a> &#8211; good, but too damn complex! They may be excellent pieces of application design, but I find them to be over-engineered.</p>


	<p>At the other end of the scale&#8230; I wrote a wiki the other day in C# (running on Mono) in Vim, via a <span class="caps">SSH</span> connection to my <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>. It weighs in at 183 lines, of which about half are blank (I like clean code me).</p>


	<p>Yes, yes I know it&#8217;s not going to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ShortestWikiContest">win a prize for being the shortest wiki</a> &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t even attempt (yet) to obey all of the &#8220;Wiki Principles&#8221;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiPrinciples but <strong>it works</strong> and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important. I&#8217;ve written smaller apps, and I&#8217;ve written <strong>much</strong> bigger apps, but my point is that C#/.NET/Mono <strong>does not force me choose either</strong>.</p>


	<h3>Convergence</h3>


	<p>This is where the .NET and Mono communities can help each other. .NET has a doctrine of <em>n</em>-tier and enterprise level applications, whilst the Mono guys are coming from the <span class="caps">UNIX</span> background of lots of small, interconnected tools. The .NET guys can help Mono in the enterprise arena, and the Mono guys can help .NET developers think about simplicity.</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Except of course he <a href="/entries/86/#c000051">does</a> (see &#8220;here:http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/03/21/aspnet#au1111596084.32 as well), but I felt the rest of the post was too good to discard.</p>
