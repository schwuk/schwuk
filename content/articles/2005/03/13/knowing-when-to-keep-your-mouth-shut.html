title: Knowing when to keep your mouth shut

<p>
    I&#8217;ve started working on a few
    <acronym title="Open Source Software">OSS</acronym> projects of my own
    &#8211; one&#8217;s in the planning stage and another is in the
    <em>code-now-plan-later</em> stage &#8211; and it got me thinking&#8230;
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When should you start talking about your projects?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    I know that the <span class="caps">OSS</span> philosphy is to &#8220;release
    early, release often&#8221; but how soon is too soon?
</p>

<p>
    Take the project that&#8217;s still in planning &#8211; if I start talking
    about it now, others may contribute to the planning and help make a better
    end-product. On the other hand, it may get so involved trying to satisfy all
    the contributors that we never get round to writing a single line of code
    &#8211; look at all the
    <acronym title="Dead Before Arrival">DBA</acronym> projects on
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. Another problem is that
    whoever is contributing may have a very different idea of how things should
    be, which is at odds with your original idea and may lead to you losing
    interest in what is (or rather now was) your project.
</p>

<p>
    Now take the second project I mentioned, which currently exists purely as
    proof-of-concept, and has no real plan other than seeing if my (extremely
    rough) ideas pan out. With a bit more work, it will be at the stage where I
    can start letting people play with it, and then comes the problem with the
    <em>code-now-plan-later</em> strategy &#8211; what do I really want it do?
</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my take on things&#8230;</p>

<p>Ask yourself this question:</p>

<h3>Why are you doing it?</h3>

<p>
    <strong
        >Only start a project if it is something you <em>really</em> want to
        do.</strong
    >
    Not because you think others will use it or do the work for you.
</p>

<p>Now you need to&#8230;</p>

<h3>Know where you want to go</h3>

<p>
    If you&#8217;re got an itch, <strong>write down some ideas</strong> before
    you scratch it. It doesn&#8217;t matter how pretty or well laid out they are
    &#8211; you don&#8217;t need a complete requirements document here, just as
    rough idea of where you&#8217;re going. In Mike Gunderloy&#8217;s book
    <a href="/entries/30">Coder To Developer</a> he describes the idea of the
    <strong>Elevator Pitch</strong> &#8211; essentially describing your idea in
    as brief, but complete (and compelling) way as possible. We&#8217;re not
    talking a one-liner here, but simple, brief bullet points that describe the
    main reasons the software should exist. Not &#8220;Create a new IM
    client&#8221;, but &#8220;Create a new IM client that supports A/B/C
    protocols, and X/Y/Z features&#8221;. The original idea behind the Elevator
    Pitch is that you only have a thirty second or so ride to sell your idea,
    but you should also see it as an opportunity to define an initial vision or
    (shudder) mission statement for the project &#8211; something that instantly
    gives people an idea of what you are trying to achieve and something you can
    refer back to when you feel you&#8217;re drifting off course.
</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to&#8230;</p>

<h3>Get started</h3>

<p>
    Now you know exactly what you&#8217;re trying to achieve, you&#8217;ve got
    two options:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Continue planning</li>
    <li>Start coding</li>
</ol>

<p>
    If you&#8217;re an organised person (I&#8217;m not, though I&#8217;d like to
    be) you&#8217;ll prefer the first option, but most people will take the
    second. That&#8217;s fine, just make sure that a) you&#8217;re still
    focusing on your original idea and b) you&#8217;re not getting distracted by
    implementation details. The main disadvantages to coding before planning are
    that you&#8217;ll rarely create the plan (as there&#8217;s far more
    interesting things to do), and if you do, you&#8217;ll most likely discover
    that you could have done things much better so you then have to go back and
    change things. You&#8217;re also far more likely to become of victim of
    feature creep. This is different from scope creep where the requirements
    keep expanding &#8211; this where you&#8217;re adding features to the
    project without any clear idea of how they or evn if they fit in with your
    original idea.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, the best advice is to do both &#8211; plan and implement your
    application at the same time. The secret to doing this successfully is to
    <strong>keep them in sync</strong> &#8211; don&#8217;t let your coding get
    ahead of the plan, and don&#8217;t neglect the code to fine-tune details
    that may get discarded or prove unfeasible during implementation.
</p>

<h3><strong>Now</strong> start talking</h3>

<p>
    Unless you&#8217;ve got an idea that you really have
    <strong>no</strong> idea how to implement, work by yourself (or with one or
    two others, but make sure they are people you can work with &#8211; not
    strangers in <span class="caps">IRC</span> or on a mailing list) and
    <strong>quietly</strong> until you&#8217;ve got something people can play
    with. If during this time you discard the project, then you&#8217;ve not
    wasted anyones time but your own. Once you&#8217;ve got something tangible,
    <strong>then</strong> release it to the world and (hopefully) start taking
    contributions.
</p>

<h3>Don&#8217;t fall asleep at the wheel</h3>

<p>
    My final piece of advice is that if others are contributing to
    <strong>your</strong> project, don&#8217;t ignore them or the project.
    People will only contribute as long as they feel their contributions are
    being paid attention to. Even if someone propose a feature that you
    don&#8217;t want to use, let them know why &#8211; don&#8217;t just discard
    it.
</p>

<p>
    If &#8211; at a later date &#8211; you are no longer interested in the
    project, either let someone else maintain it or let people know it is no
    longer maintained.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    So, in a nutshell &#8211; don&#8217;t talk about your projects until there
    is something to see/feel, and don&#8217;t neglect your project once it has
    been released.
</p>

<p>
    Although I&#8217;ve really been talking about
    <span class="caps">OSS</span> projects here, the same ideas about the
    &#8220;Elevator Pitch&#8221; and simultaneous planning &#38; implementation
    can be applied to proprietary/commercial projects. I make extensive use use
    of the latter in my day job, and when done properly works very well.
    Obviously it doesn&#8217;t suit all projects, but for smaller applications
    it produces results far quicker than traditional methodologies.
</p>

<p>
    If you&#8217;re looking for a tool to help you achieve this, look no further
    than <a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a>. It&#8217;s tight
    integration of the wiki, Subversion, and tickets makes for a very organic
    development process, and allows easy maintenance of the plans and
    documentation by all members of the development team. Again this is a
    professional recommendation as I use it to manage all of my projects in my
    day job, as well as a few of my personal/professional projects.
