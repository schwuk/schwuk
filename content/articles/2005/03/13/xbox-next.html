<p>Short post pulling together some bit &#38; peices surrounding the new Xbox&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Offical <span class="caps">GDC</span> Coverage</h3>


	<p>Xbox.com are <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/press/gdc05/default.htm">providing</a> <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/xboxtv/default.htm?t=5226&#38;v=92591">video</a> and audio (<a href="http://www.major-nelson.com/blogcast/GDCKeynotemp3.mp3"><span class="caps">MP3</span></a>, <a href="http://www.major-nelson.com/blogcast/GDC%20Keynotewma.wma"><span class="caps">WMA</span></a>) feeds of J Allard&#8217;s keynote address. They&#8217;ve also got a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/xboxtv/default.htm?t=5226&#38;v=92561&#38;level1=enushome&#38;level2=media1&#38;level3=gdckeynotevid">demo video</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/media/system/gdc05/downloads/gdc05-highres.zip">screenshots</a> of the Xbox Guide &#8211; what appears to be a common interface to Live, media and other content which will be available regardless of the game you are currently playing.</p>


	<h3>Unofficial <span class="caps">GDC</span> Coverage and Speculation</h3>


	<p>Gamespy have been gleaning information from <span class="caps">GDC</span> attendees &#38; developers, and have posted (purely speculative, but interesting nonetheless) information about the <a href="http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/microsoft-xbox/594331p1.html">hardware</a> and <a href="http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/microsoft-xbox/594355p1.html">Live integration and Gamer Profiles</a>.</p>


	<p>Gamer Profiles sound cool from a configuration point of view &#8211; it&#8217;s frustrating to have to set your name and control preferences for each game. I also like the idea of the gamer achievements as it proves you&#8217;ve done what you claim to.</p>


	<h3>Is This What The Hardware Will Look Like?</h3>


	<p><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000373035668/">Joystiq</a> have a photo of what they reckon the new hardware will look like. Engadget <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000987035687/">refute</a> this, citing a trusted source that this is a prototype. Seeing as the photo <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/9253838747326816/">corresponds</a> with an earlier Engadget posting, it certainly looks legitimate even if it&#8217;s not the final hardware.</p>


	<p>Not sure about the handle, but it&#8217;s certainly not as ugly as the original <span class="caps">PS2</span> or even the original Xbox.</p>


	<p>Personally, based on the comments coming from Microsoft about how they see the next Xbox as being part of the whole home media experience, I&#8217;d expect it to be more <span class="caps">DVD</span> player looking than this design, but seeing as there&#8217;s some weird and wonderful looking <span class="caps">DVD</span> players out there who knows&#8230;</p>


	<h3>My (and others) Thoughts</h3>


	<p>Tycho from Penny Arcade <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2005-03-09">says</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>More interesting even than the raw numbers are the policies they plan to implement for developers, which they suggest are things like compulsory live functionality, custom soundtracks, widescreen, and 720p.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...and he&#8217;s got it dead right. I&#8217;ve <a href="/entries/64">commented</a> in the past how much I like Xbox Live, but since then I&#8217;ve grown frustrated with the way that each game implements it slightly (sometimes completely) differently. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the service is still great, it&#8217;s just not <em>consistant</em> depending on the game you are playing. The same was true for custom soundtracks &#8211; great idea but too few games implemented it. If they can enforce these policies successfully, then it will be great for gamers.</p>
