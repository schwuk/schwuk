<p>The other day I <a href="/entries/89">mentioned</a> Boo (still not sure on the capitalisation). Now Ed Dumbhill (one of the guys behind Mono: A Developers Notebook) has <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/03/26-ironpython/read">voiced his disappointment with the recent IronPython 0.7 release</a>  &#8211; particularly the seemingly closed development process and the fact  that it doesn&#8217;t work with Mono &#8211; then goes on to <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/03/26-boo/read">extol the virtues of Boo</a>.</p>


	<p>Looks like I found Boo at the right time&#8230;</p>
