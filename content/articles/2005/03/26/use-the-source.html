<p>Found this via <a href="http://www.macewan.org/index.php?p=274">Robert MacEwan</a>. It appears there may be be some <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/?MonoDebianPlan">problems with packaging Mono on Debian</a> that may not get resolved in the near future.</p>


	<p>I guess us debianites will just have to continue using the source&#8230;</p>


	<p>While I&#8217;m thinking about it though, Ubuntu <strong>is</strong> managing to package Mono, so is Debian being too picky? I don&#8217;t really know enough about  it so I&#8217;ll shut up now.</p>
