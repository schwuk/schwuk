<p>Just catching up on a few odds and ends (mainly Mono related) that don&#8217;t really warrant their own post.</p>


	<h3>How BitTorrent Works</h3>


	<p>Ever wondered how <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com">BitTorrent</a> works?
Go check out this <a href="http://aphid.org/btsim/">simulator</a> (<a href="http://www.java.com">Java</a> required).</p>


	<p>Pretty cool watching empty nodes fill up and start seeding others.</p>


	<h3>Mono/Cygwin CD</h3>


	<p><a href="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/">Paco</a> has released the <span class="caps">ISO</span> of his <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> / <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> CD.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>This CD contains, multimedia tutorials tarballs with Mono source code, installers ready to use and most important, a very comprehensive Cygwin installation specially configured to work in tandem with the Mono 1.1.4 Win32 installer for building Mono, <span class="caps">XSP</span>, Gtk# and others from source code as described in the OÃ¢??Reilly article (also included in the CD) <a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2005/02/07/monowindows.html">here</a></p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Limited time offer only, so I won&#8217;t link directly to the torrent &#8211; check out his <a href="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/000074.html">announcement</a> instead.</p>


	<h3>Mono Presentation</h3>


	<p>Paco has also released video of the talk <strong>Mono Development for Windows .NET Programmers</strong> presented by various Mono team members at the Plano .NET User Group meeting.</p>


	<p>Again, it&#8217;s only available for a limited time, so go <a href="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/000073.html">here</a> to see if it&#8217;s still available.</p>


	<h3>Introduction To Mono articles</h3>


	<p><a href="http://briandela.com/">Brian Delahunty</a> has a couple of good articles introducing Mono up on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">The Code Project</a>:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cpnet/introtomono1.asp">Introduction to Mono &#8211; Your first Mono app</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cpnet/introtomono2.asp">Introduction to Mono &#8211; <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET with <span class="caps">XSP</span> and Apache</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>I look forward to seeing what he produces in future installments&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Open Source Software in C#</h3>


	<p>Via <a href="http://larkware.com/">The Daily Grind</a>.</p>


	<p>A site attempting to catalogue various Open Source Software projects written in C#.</p>

	<h3>Regular Expression Library</h3>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Welcome to RegExLib.com, the Internet&#8217;s first Regular Expression Library. Currently we have indexed 913  expressions from  contributors around the world. We hope you&#8217;ll find this site useful and come back whenever you&#8217;re looking for an expression for a particular task, or have just figured out a new expression that does something useful. Thanks!</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>The regexes are written with .NET in mind, but should be portable to other languages (particularly <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>). I&#8217;ve not yet tested any of them, so I can&#8217;t comment on the quality.</p>

	<h3>How to setup a .NET Development Tree</h3>


	<p><a href="http://mikeroberts.thoughtworks.net/blog/">Mike Roberts</a> has wrapped up his excellent series on creating a .NET development tree into a single <a href="http://mikeroberts.thoughtworks.net/blog/archive/Tech/ArticlesandPapers/Howtosetupa.NETDevelopmentTree.html">article</a>.</p>


	<p>This can be supplemented with his <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/TREE/Tree+Surgeon">Tree Surgeon</a> tool which does the manual work for you.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve used both his articles and the tool to setup a tree for a project I recently started, and I thoroughly recommend you check them out.</p>
