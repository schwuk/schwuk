<p>Both the PC and Xbox demos are available for the <a href="http://splintercell.com/us/splintercellchaostheory/">third installment</a> of <a href="http://www.splintercell.com/">Splinter Cell</a>.</p>


	<p>The graphics (on the Xbox) are simply <em>stunning</em>. As Gabe from <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> says:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I must have sat there and watched water pour onto a cement floor for about five minutes.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I know exactly what he means. Of course graphics don&#8217;t make a game, but combined with the physics, rag doll effects and audio it&#8217;s a fantastic experience. The demo takes place on the lighthouse level, and makes excellent use of weather effects.</p>


	<p>I love it when game developers have a decent sense of humour, so go check out their <a href="http://splintercell.com/us/splintercellchaostheory/videos.php"><span class="caps">NSA</span> Training Videos</a> and <a href="http://www.splintercell.com/us/community_pennyarcades.php">comic</a> (drawn by <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a>).</p>


	<p>Playing the demo has made me re-visit Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow (which I&#8217;d skipped for some reason). The game is very good, but the multiplayer is fantastic!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m finding a lot more time for gaming at the moment &#8211; I guess it&#8217;s because work is so hectic I&#8217;m preferring to stay away from the computer during personal time.</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>
