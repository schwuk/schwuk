<p>I was hoping to be sitting in a crowded hall in Amsterdam this week, but unfortunately I was unable to attend <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/teched/05/pre/content/default.aspx">Tech-Ed Europe</a> as I&#8217;d planned. I&#8217;m disappointed I didn&#8217;t get to go, but with a bit of forward planning I may get to go the US one (the &#8220;proper&#8221; one) next year. There&#8217;s always <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/"><span class="caps">PDC</span>&#8217;05</a> as well if I&#8217;m lucky&#8230;</p>
