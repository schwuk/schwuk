<p>Thanks to Microsoft, the postman delivered lots of goodies for me :</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2</li>
		<li>Web Developer Kit<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></li>
		<li>Mobile Application Development Toolkit</li>
		<li>Visual Basic .NET Resource Kit</li>
		<li>Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional (60 day trial)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>I didn&#8217;t ask for the last two, but they were nice enough to send them to me. In fact I now have four 60 day trials of VS.NET 2003 as they include one in each of the other packs (except of course <span class="caps">VS 2005</span>). Shame I&#8217;ve already got a licensed copy really&#8230;</p>


	<p>Now why did I get all this? I signed up for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/uk/msdn/connection/default.mspx"><span class="caps">MSDN</span> Connection</a> &#8211; a free service from Microsoft. As well as the free stuff, I also get discounts on various things including 50% off selected books. Not bad at all.</p>


	<p>One interesting nugget which I&#8217;ve not yet looked into is in the Web Developer Kit : <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET for <span class="caps">PHP</span> programmers. If it&#8217;s any good I&#8217;ll show to some of my <span class="caps">PHP</span> orientated associates.</p>


	<p>Off I go to install Visual Studio 2005&#8230;</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Listed as <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET Resource Kit, but contains far more stuff than the one I downloaded ages ago.</p>
