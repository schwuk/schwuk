<p>I&#8217;ve written a small utility for myself which I&#8217;ve now decided to release publically. It will most likely end up as an open source project, but in preparation for releasing it I&#8217;ve been prettying it up.</p>


	<p>...or at least I&#8217;ve been trying to&#8230;</p>


	<p>A major stumbling block for the hobbyist (which is how I class my personal developments &#8211; yes I <strong>do</strong> write code for a living) developer is a lack of decent artwork/icons that <strong>don&#8217;t cost a fortune</strong>.</p>


	<p>Sure, if I&#8217;m going to release a piece of software commercially I could justify paying for some artwork, but for a freeware/open source project I can&#8217;t.</p>


	<p>Surely there will be some resources out there, but try googling for &#8220;free icons&#8221; and see how far you get!</p>


	<h3>Viral Licensing</h3>


	<p>Another thing I&#8217;m not sure about is whether I can use <span class="caps">GPL</span> icons in a non-GPL app? I&#8217;m pretty sure I can&#8217;t unless there is specific exemption, or they are <span class="caps">LGPL</span>. Stuff licensed under Creative Commons is more obvious (although harder to find), but it&#8217;s not completely clear.</p>
