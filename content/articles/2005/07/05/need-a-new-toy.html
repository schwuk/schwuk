<p>Although I&#8217;m pretty happy with my aging Palm Vx, recently it&#8217;s picked up a few serious scratches to the screen which are really annoying me. I don&#8217;t want to pay the premium for a brand new device, especially with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/5/default.mspx">Windows Mobile 5.0</a> based devices and the <a href="/entries/120">Nokia 770 Internet Tablet</a> around the corner, so I&#8217;ve been scouring <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/">eBay</a> (my new addiction) for options.</p>


	<p>Currently I&#8217;m limiting my choices to:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Replacing the screen on Palm Vx (not something I want to do without having a backup device available)</li>
		<li>Replacing the Vx with another one, or maybe a slightly higher spec one (m505 maybe)</li>
		<li>Getting a Microsoft Smartphone (probably an Orange <span class="caps">SPV E500</span>)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>I could easily get a brand new Smartphone by getting another contract, but a) I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll like the platform, b) again there&#8217;s new devices on the way and c) I&#8217;m not a big fan of contract phones. I want to upgrade when I want, not when they let me. Although there&#8217;s loads of E200s available, I&#8217;m playing a waiting game to see if I can get myself a bargain.</p>


	<p>Of course I&#8217;ll probably get sick of waiting, and shell out for a brand new <a href="http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx?c=uk&#38;cs=ukdhs1&#38;id=axim_x50v&#38;l=en&#38;s=dhs">Dell x50V</a> like my friend Mat just has&#8230;</p>
