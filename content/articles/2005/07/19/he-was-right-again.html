<p>Once upon a time, I <a href="/entries/44">complained</a> about Scott Hanselman pimping a piece of commercial software when there was a perfectly good open-source alternative available.</p>


	<p>Except there <a href="/entries/45">wasn&#8217;t</a>, and I was wrong. <em>Mea culpa</em>.</p>


	<p>Since then it will be obvious to regular readers that I am no longer so adverse to commercial software, especially when there is no clear free/open-source alternative.</p>


	<h3>FinePrint</h3>


	<p>The other day, Scott once again <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImInLoveWithFinePrint.aspx">waxed lyrical</a> about some life (or rather paper in this case) saving software called <a href="http://www.fineprint.com/products/fineprint/index.html">FinePrint</a>. I read it, it vaguely piqued my curiosity, and then I promptly forgot about it.</p>


	<p>Until today.</p>


	<p>Now, normally I try to be as paperless as possible, but sometimes you can&#8217;t beat holding a lump of dead tree in your hand. I find this especially to be the case when dealing with books (although I&#8217;m also a big fan of eBooks) and long technical papers. When I read stuff on the screen, I always find I skip stuff.</p>


	<p>Today I needed to review a document written by a colleague. I needed to make notes <strong>on</strong> it, and also create a new document <strong>from</strong> it. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have a multi-monitor set-up at the moment, so I decided to print it out. Then I realised it was 30 pages long, and my aging <span class="caps">EPSON</span> Stylus Photo 890 doesn&#8217;t do duplex. It does do multi-page though, but I wanted to use as little paper as possible. I was just figuring out how to both multi-page <strong>and</strong> manual duplex when FinePrint came to mind. A few minutes  later and the problem was solved and I could move on.</p>


	<p>Fantastic piece of software, and highly recommended.</p>


	<p>Of course if anyone knows of an F/OSS alternative, let me know.</p>
