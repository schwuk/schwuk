	<p>Someone has put together a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevewhitepsfd/archive/2005/07/07/436519.aspx">3D File System Visualizer</a> using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/default.aspx">Avalon</a>. Whilst this shows the power of the technologies used, it  is as Mike says:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>exactly the sort of horrid user interface that I fear Avalon is going to enable developers to saddle us with</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I hate apps that tout skinning or theming as a significant feature, and I&#8217;m worried that if Avalon makes it easy to do 3D interfaces, then they will become a new pet hate of mine (and others).</p>


	<p>To quote Uncle Ben<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>With great power comes great responsibility</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...or to put it another way, just because you <em>can</em> (do fancy 3D interfaces/representations) doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should</em>.</p>
