	<p>Well Mrs. Schwuk picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747581088">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> for me last night. I started reading at around 9pm yesterday, went to bed some time after 3am and finished around 12pm today. I know lots of people belittle the quality/originality of JK Rowling&#8217;s writing, but I will unashamedly say she writes a damn good story, and I honestly could not put it down (apart from when I was so tired I could no longer focus on the page). A damn fine read, and and excellent continuation of the story.</p>


	<p>If you like Harry Potter, then you&#8217;ve probably already got it. If you don&#8217;t, try it again. If you haven&#8217;t tried it, then you are missing out&#8230;</p>
