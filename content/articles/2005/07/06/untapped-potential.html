<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush for Visual Studio</a> for some time now, but it turns out I had no idea of what it was really capable of&#8230;</p>


	<p>I was watching some of the <a href="http://groktalks.net">GrokTalks</a> I <a href="/entries/128">pimped</a> yesterday &#8211; in particular Scott Hanselman&#8217;s <a href="http://mediaserver.aspsoft.com/blog/ScottHanselmanPresenting10UtilitiesIn10Minutes.aspx">10 Utilities in 10 Minutes</a> which is an <em>extremely</em> cut down version of his <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Trackback.aspx?guid=cbb7f3df-b9dd-4a4a-8cc6-83d87c117d26">2005 Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List</a>. In both of these he covers CodeRush, saying:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Apparently my enthusiasm for CodeRush has been noticed by a few. It just keeps getting better. However, the best kept secret about CodeRush isn&#8217;t all the shiny stuff, it&#8217;s the free Extensibility Engine called DxCore that brings VS.NET plugins to the masses.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...and I figured fair enough, I&#8217;ll agree with that &#8211; I&#8217;m using it and I like it. Then I watched his GrokTalk and realised I was just seeing the tip of the iceberg!</p>


	<p>You see CodeRush has <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/Templates.xml">Code Templates</a>.  Obviously I&#8217;d seen these in action (because you can&#8217;t help but trigger them), but I didn&#8217;t realise how <strong>extensive</strong> (and customisable) they were. Now I can write huge swathes of (clean) code with very little effort.</p>


	<p>I love any tool that makes my life easier, and this is one of them!</p>
