<p>Not that I would <strong>ever</strong> cite Slashdot as an authorative source, but their recent <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/14/2341212">coverage</a> of a story about the <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/opr/nms/newsreleases/2005/rink.html">discovery of the remains of a gigantic ape</a> without <strong>any</strong> comment on the timing by either the poster or the &#8220;editors&#8221; stuns me. I&#8217;ve not fully <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/rtfa"><span class="caps">RTFA</span></a> but the simple fact of the timing of the release (which published on November 7th) and upcoming release of Peter Jackson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.kingkongmovie.com/">King Kong</a> makes me question its authority. In the words of one /. poster:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Makes me wonder if someone was paid to withhold this information untill King Kong&#8217;s release or is being paid to release it when it&#8217;s unconfirmed.</p>
