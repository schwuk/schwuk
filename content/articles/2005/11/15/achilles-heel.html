<p>Ghworg (part of <a href="http://www.rimron.co.uk/lugradio">Planet #lugradio</a>) recently posted about his efforts to <a href="http://www.trollgod.org.uk/archives/2005/11/07/stopping-lockups-with-nvidia-drivers-and-agp/">stop lockups with nvidia drivers and <span class="caps">AGP</span></a>.</p>


	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudos">Kudos</a> to Ghworg both for solving his problem <strong>and</strong> blogging it so others can learn from it (I&#8217;ve done <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/04/08/compiling-mplayer-on-ubuntu-hoary">similar</a> things myself). However, seeing stuff like this just makes me shudder. Sure it&#8217;s one of the greatest strengths of Linux, but to me it&#8217;s also one its greatest weaknesses. It&#8217;s great that you <strong>can</strong> fix stuff like this (<strong>if</strong> you know what you&#8217;re doing), but <strong>how</strong> is a normal user going to figure out something like this? Google is not a sufficient answer as <em>knowledge does not imply ability</em>.</p>


	<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not advocating using another OS over Linux &#8211; after all, you wouldn&#8217;t even be able to fix a problem like this &#8211; but I believe that things like this will prevent Linux from becoming the mainstream desktop OS so many people would like it to be.</p>
