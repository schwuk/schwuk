<p>So with my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/21/new-shoes">new shoes</a> and a <a href="http://www.outdoorgarage.com/acatalog/High_Gear_Easi_Pedometer.html">pedometer</a> my mother bought for me today, I set off on my third run.</p>


	<p>The shoes (and possibly a few days rest as well) made a world of difference. Because I&#8217;m currently staying with my brother-in-law in darkest surburbia (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=hersham&#38;spn=0.049287,0.120352&#38;hl=en">Hersham</a>, near Walton-on-Thames to be precise) and I was pushed for time, I went for a shorter run than my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/18/first-attempt">previous</a> (successful) attempt.</p>


	<p>According to the pedometer I&#8230;</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Ran for 21 minutes</li>
		<li>Covered 2.247 miles</li>
		<li>Took 3301 strides</li>
		<li>Burnt 275.7 calories</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Being a typical geek, I love the idea of collecting this sort of information. Admittedly it&#8217;s not quite as cool as Mikes <a href="http://uffish.net/archives/000306.html">version</a>, but I can&#8217;t really justify that sort of kit at my current level.</p>


	<p>What is pretty cool about the pedometer is that only records <strong>when</strong> you&#8217;re moving, so if you do stop for a break, it&#8217;s deducted from your overall time.</p>
