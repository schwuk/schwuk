<p>Inspired by a IM conversation I was having with a fellow <a href="http://cumbria.lug.org.uk"><span class="caps">LUG</span></a> member who showed me a list of his home network hardware on his wiki I decided to do something similar.</p>


	<p>Except of course I don&#8217;t have a (public) wiki<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>...</p>


	<p>So <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a> to the rescue once <a href="/entries/111">again</a>:</p>
