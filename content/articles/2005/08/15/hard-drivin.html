<p>This weekend I needed to make a trip to London to visit my sister and pick up my mother to bring her home. For various reasons, I decided the best plan was to drive there and back <strong>in one day</strong>.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s right, Cumbria to London &#8211; ~330 miles (according to Google Maps) each way and four motorways: M6, <span class="caps">M42</span>, M40 and (shudder) <span class="caps">M25</span>.</p>


	<p>I need my head examined.</p>


	<p>We set off just before midnight on Friday, stopped at Warwick services on the <span class="caps">M42</span> for  an hours nap and arrived at our destination at around 7AM. A fairly bust day followed, then we left again at 18:45. We paused briefly in Birmingham to visit my 92 year old grandmother and consume a backet of <span class="caps">KFC</span>, and arrived home at 2AM Sunday morning.</p>


	<p>We were <strong>extremely</strong> lucky with the traffic &#8211; only stopping once on the way back when they decided to reduce the M6 to one lane, but everyone in lanes 2 &#38; 3 decided to ignore the signs and wait to the last minute to get in. That winds me up <strong>so</strong> much!</p>


	<p>For some reason I didn&#8217;t get up until noon today (or rather yesterday)...</p>
