<p>My desk (and office) is now a lot tidier than it was&#8230;</p>

	<p>This is by no means the worst I&#8217;ve seen it, but it was pretty cluttered. Most stuff on there has been there for ages, and rarely touched (or even moved).</p>


	<p>This morning I decided to do something about it, then remembered a <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/productivity_tip_throw_everything_on_your_desk_in_a_box.php">piece</a> on Signal vs. Noise a couple of weeks ago about the same thing. Suitably inspired, I shovelled everything non-essential into a box, or in the case of the small monitor &#38; extra keyboard I put them on top of the computers they were serving.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve still got too many power blocks and cables, but it&#8217;s a start. In all honesty with my WiFi I&#8217;m finding I spend less time in here now anyway, so there&#8217;s no reason for it to be so messy!</p>
