<p>Well that didn&#8217;t go according to plan.</p>


	<p>After my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/18/first-attempt">first attempt</a> I felt tired, but not too bad. The next day (yesterday) I was noticeably stiff, particularly the front of my thighs.</p>


	<p>This morning I again woke at 6AM and headed out. I completed the first section (my circuit has five sections) without much of a problem. I felt I was slower and could definitely feel the stiffness in my muscles, but I ran it in about the same time as before.</p>


	<p>As I progressed on to the second section a nagging pain in my right foot became more noticeable, and I realised I was sub-conciously favouring it which in turn was slowing me down more. After about approx. &frac12; of a mile, I decided I was going too slow to complete my circuit in my alloted time and the pain was too distracting. So I walked back to the start of the 2<sup>nd</sup> section, and ran the first section in reverse.</p>


	<p>So including breaks and the walk, today I think I ran approx. 2&frac14; miles in ~35 minutes.</p>


	<p>The pain in my right foot affected the outside edge and heel. I&#8217;m not sure what the cause is but I suspect it&#8217;s simply a combination of bad running style and bad shoes, both of which can be addressed.</p>


	<p>In hindsight I&#8217;m guessing it wasn&#8217;t too bright an idea to go again so soon after my first attempt &#8211; I didn&#8217;t really give my body time to recover. Next time I&#8217;m going to give myself a few days before trying again.</p>


	<p>Things to buy:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Pedometer (or more likely a <span class="caps">GPS</span>)</li>
		<li>Heart Rate Monitor</li>
		<li><span class="caps">MP3</span> Player</li>
		<li>Decent pair of running shoes!</li>
	</ul>


	<p>At least two of the above might be solved with <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner301/">this</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll might turn this into an <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a> list if I can be bothered.</p>
