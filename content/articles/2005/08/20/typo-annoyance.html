<p>I&#8217;ve found a very annoying feature of <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a>:</p>


	<p>When you create a post via the web interface (as I normally do) the date is set to the time you <strong>started</strong> writing the post, not the time you actually click &#8220;Publish&#8221;.</p>


	<p>It should be fairly trivial to fix, I just need to sit down and do it.</p>
