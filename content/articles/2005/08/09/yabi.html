<p>(Yet Another Bad Idea)</p>


	<p>From Engadget: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000560053721/">Brits to get <span class="caps">RFID</span>-chipped license plates</a></p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>The UK Department for Transport just gave the go-ahead for a trial of new, <span class="caps">RFID</span>-enabled license plates aimed to make vehicles trackable in Britain.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>OK as a card-carrying geek, I like technical solutions but I&#8217;m not sure what problem they&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Unlike passive <span class="caps">RFID</span> which only transmits over short distances, the e-Plate licenses use active <span class="caps">RFID</span> technology to transmit vehicle identification numbers and other data to readers over 300 feet away.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Fair enough <span class="caps">VIN</span> numbers, but what&#8217;s the &#8220;other data&#8221;? What else is needed? And what&#8217;s with the &#8220;active <span class="caps">RFID</span>&#8221; and transmitting &#8220;over 300 feet away&#8221;?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m sure the appropriate enforcing legislation will be pushed through under the guise of <em>preventing terrorism</em>, and I can see how they think it can be used for tracking vehicles, tackling speeding and replacing/supplement road tax but unless it&#8217;s married to some sort of enforcement/verification system it will be useless as people will either disable them, or clone someone elses. Then there&#8217;s the part that <span class="caps">RFID</span> is essentially open if you have the right tools &#8211; if the government can track you, so can others.</p>


	<p>So, <em>technically</em> a sound idea (but obviously not well thought through), guaranteed to be badly implemented (as all initiatives like this are), and we&#8217;ll most likely have to foot the bill.</p>
