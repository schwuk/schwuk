<p>Last week I wandered into my local <a href="http://shop.game.net/">Game</a> outlet to fill some time. I noticed they had some <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx"><span class="caps">PSP</span></a> hardware behind the counter, so I got talking to a member of staff and a few minutes later I had one of the demo units in my grubby mitts.</p>


	<p>Wow.</p>


	<p>This is one slick device, and I will be seriously tempted to get one when released. Apart from the general high quality of the unit (the screen is <strong>gorgeous</strong>) and the games (not far off the the <span class="caps">PS2</span> quality that everyone has been saying) and the stunning price &#8211; Â£179 &#8211; theres currently quite an active <a href="http://playstation.hackaday.com/">hacking</a> (in the traditional sense) <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000720038308/">scene</a> developing around them and it is this that interests me more. They&#8217;ve even got <a href="http://www.yankidank.com/article.php?story=20050707032717341"><span class="caps">VNC</span></a> running on it!</p>


	<p>Sony have promised to block some of the exploits being used to achieve these hacks with the european release, so I&#8217;m waiting to see how successful they are before handing over my money. Especially with the presumably hacker friendly (given it&#8217;s origins) Nokia 770 hopefully available soon at a similar price point.</p>
