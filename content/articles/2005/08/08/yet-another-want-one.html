    I&#8217;m never been a big one for hardware hacking (although I&#8217;m
    slowly talking myself into a
    <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">Make</a> subscription), but reading about
    the
    <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000840053552/">RC lawn mower</a>
    on Engadget really inspires me to have a go at something like this.

    If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that I know nothing about mechanics, motors
    or remote control. Still, a Linux powered robotic lawn mower controlled by
    WiFi <strong>would</strong> be cool, wouldn&#8217;t it&#8230; :)
