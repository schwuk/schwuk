<p>...seems a far apter name than Minimo to me, but the choice isn&#8217;t mine to make&#8230;</p>


	<p>I was already aware of the original <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/">Minimo</a> project, but thought it had stalled. Somehow I missed the <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6072">announcement</a> that it was going to be developed for Windows CE. Now it seems I&#8217;ve also missed (preview) <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=7024">release</a> of said port.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d be more enthusiastic about this if I had a CE device to use it on, but I haven&#8217;t so I&#8217;ll just file it under cool, forward it to my Pocket PC owning friends and move on.</p>
