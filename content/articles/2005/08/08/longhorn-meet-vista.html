title: Longhorn, meet Vista

<p>I&#8217;ve not been paying too much attention to Longhorn (now Vista) because as with Visual Studio 2005, there simply too much stuff available now without wasting energy on the stuff that&#8217;s coming soon. Luckily not all people have my attitude<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, and the O&#8217;Reilly Network (again) have put together an (in their ords) in-depth look at the current beta:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><a href="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/08/02/vista.html">An In-Depth Look at Vista, Part 1</a> by Wei-Meng Lee&#8212;The long wait for the first beta of Microsoft&#8217;s new Windows OS is finally over. Wei-Meng Lee took it for a spin and gives a detailed overview of Vista.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>From reading the article, I&#8217;ll say that it looks <em>interesting</em>, but that&#8217;s all. They didn&#8217;t cover anythng you can&#8217;t do in XP or Linux with a little effort. Virtual folders sound cool, but I&#8217;m sure someone in the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> camp are already thinking about how to integrate Beagle searches into Nautilus.</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>


	<p>They&#8217;ve posted a second article:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p> <a href="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/08/16/vista2.html">An In-Depth Look at Vista, Part 2</a>  by Wei-Meng Lee&#8212;Wei-Meng Lee has had time to explore some of the cooler aspects of Vista, such as Aero Glass and Broadcast Presentations. He shows you how to troubleshoot them and get Vista up and running.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>The Aero effects look nice, but there&#8217;s still not a lot there. In other news though I&#8217;ve got a new work computer (hopefully) arriving today which will be powerful enough to run it, so I may post my own opinions soon.</p>


<hr />

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> which has nothing at all to do with the fact my current (aging) computer struggles to run the latter and would probably run away whimpering if I asked it to run the former, honest.</p>
