<p>
    Today I turned 31, and with birthday money from various relatives I treated
    myself to some decent running shoes.
</p>

<p>
    That&#8217;s one off my
    <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2005/08/20/second-attempt">list</a>!
</p>

<p>
    I also got some running gear from my wife, so I am now much better equipped.
</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;ve been looking into <span class="caps">MP3</span> players and
    despite being quite enamoured with the
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/">iPod shuffle</a> a friend
    showed me his &pound;20 SD based player from
    <a
        href="http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10001&#38;langId=-1&#38;catalogId=3801&#38;productId=148454&#38;clickfrom=name"
        >Argos</a
    >. He complained about it not playing by album, but seeing as shuffle
    doesn&#8217;t either, and generally use
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/">iTunes</a> in Party Shuffle mode
    anyway this isn&#8217;t really much of a concern for me. I&#8217;ve doing
    some looking on eBay and there are various similar devices on offer for
    roughly the same price, and decent sized SD cards weigh in at roughly the
    same price I could have a 1GB (expandable)
    <span class="caps">MP3</span> player for &frac12; the cost of the 1GB
    shuffle. The shuffle is still &#8216;cooler&#8217; though&#8230;
