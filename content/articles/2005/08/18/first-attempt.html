<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to do something about my general fitness for a while. I never been a big one for gyms and machines &#8211; I much prefer &#8216;natural&#8217; exercise.</p>


	<p>So this morning for the first time in quite a few years, I got up and went running.</p>


	<p>I got up at 6AM and was out of the house by 6:15. I covered a simple loop that is somewhere between 4 &#38; 5 miles and delivered me back to my door. I started off running well, and finished running (not so well), but in between I did occasionally slow to a jog and also had a few (very brief) walks. I was back by 7:15.</p>


	<p>Apart from general fitness, I do have a specific goal in mind but I&#8217;m not going to talk about that until I&#8217;m happy with my progress. I&#8217;m happy with my first attempt though!</p>
