<p>After a brief no-gaming spell, I find myself playing games once again. My <a href="http://cityofheroes.com/">CoH</a> trial has expired, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m going to subscribe. I really want to try out <a href="http://www.guildwars.com/">Guild Wars</a> as well, but this weekend I&#8217;ve picked up the game I&#8217;ve been waiting for&#8230; <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/">Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas</a>. Although I&#8217;ve still got my <span class="caps">PS2</span>, I rarely play games on it now so I waited for the Xbox version to be released before picking it up. I&#8217;ve been a fan of <span class="caps">GTA</span> since the beginning, and I can safely say they&#8217;ve done it again.</p>


	<p>Last night Mrs. Schwuk and I went to see <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0356910/">Mr. &#38; Mrs. Smith</a> with some friends and as with <span class="caps">GTA</span>:SA I can thoroughly recommend it. Slow in places, but well worth watching.</p>


	<p>Recently &#8211; thanks to Sky (One &#38; Mix), E4 and Paramount Comedy Channel &#8211; I&#8217;ve gotten heavily into &#8220;Scrubs&#8221;. Fantastic series on so many levels. I&#8217;m (im)patiently awaiting the boxed sets to be released&#8230;</p>
