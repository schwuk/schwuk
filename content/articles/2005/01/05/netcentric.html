<p>mrBen has a nice <a href="http://www.jedimoose.org/index.php/archives/2005/01/05/how-the-web-has-changed/">piece</a> on the past, present and future of his internet experience.</p>


	<p>My experience is very similiar, although it started in 1996 via a shared, s-l-o-w dial-up connection. I soon graduated to my own connection, eventually settling on <span class="caps">ISDN</span> for a good few years during which my life became very &#8216;net (and computer) centric. I basically lived and worked on the &#8216;net, and if I couldn&#8217;t find it there I was very disappointed.</p>


	<p>Now with my leap into the 21st century with broadband (did I mention I have broadband now? w00t!), things I enjoyed before (email, <span class="caps">IRC</span>, IM and of course browsing) I&#8217;m placing into the &#8216;as-essential-as-breathing&#8217; category, and things I avoided before (music, video, large downloads) I take for granted. I&#8217;m even looking at things like VoIP which was <strong>never</strong> an option before. Sure I could use <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> but I couldn&#8217;t do anything else at the same time. Now I&#8217;m doing multiple things simultaneously, and still have bandwidth to spare.</p>


	<p>My current handheld is a disconnected Palm Vx. Whatever I choose to replace this will have to be connected so it can become a proper extension of my &#8216;netcentric&#8217; lifestyle.</p>


	<p>See you online&#8230;</p>
