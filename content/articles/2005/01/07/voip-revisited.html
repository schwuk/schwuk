<p>Matt Revell posts about <a href="http://www.understated.co.uk/blog/2005/01/vonage-launches-in-uk.html">Vonage&#8217;s entry into the UK VoIP market</a> and more interestingly why these services may ultimately kill themselves.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve written about VoIP <a href="/entries/17">before</a> and although I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://skype.com/">Skype</a> I tend not to use it extensively because none of my contacts seem to use it&#8230; Catch 22.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve not played with <a href="http://skype.com/store/buy/skypeout.html">SkypeOut</a> &#8211; their solution for ringing landlines from Skype &#8211; yet, but the <a href="http://skype.com/products/skypeout/rates/">rates</a> look attractive.</p>


	<p>A big downside to Skype (for me) is the (current) lack of a &#8216;SkypeIn&#8217; solution. I need the ability to receive incoming calls from landlines.</p>


	<p>Until Skype offer such a service, I&#8217;ve signed up with Nildram&#8217;s (my <span class="caps">ISP</span>) <a href="http://voip.nildram.net/">VoIP service</a> (currently in trials) as they provide an incoming number, voicemail, and free calls to UK freephone numbers (Skype charges for these). So far it seems pretty good &#8211; although I have had a few problems with echo so now I&#8217;m looking into standalone hardware units.</p>
