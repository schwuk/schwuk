<p>Last Wednesday (January 19th) my phone line (and <span class="caps">ADSL</span>) started playing up. The following day it was pining for the fjords.</p>


	<p>Our wonderful telecommunications provider <a href="http://www.bt.com/">BT</a> won&#8217;t even come to look at it until <strong>next</strong> Thursday (February 3rd) citing the repair for the recent storms as the reason for the delay.</p>


	<p>To add insult to injury, BT are <a href="http://www.cumberland-news.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=172356">stating</a> that the storms were an &#8220;act of god&#8221; and are refusing to pay any compensation for loss of service. I&#8217;m waiting to find out if I&#8217;m included in this.</p>


	<p>Sometimes it sucks to live out in the countryside<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>...</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> But then I go for a walk outside (or even just look out of the window) and remember why I put up with this sort of thing to live here.</p>
