	<p>As <a href="/entries/57">previously mentioned</a>, <a href="http://larkware.com/">Mike Gunderloy</a> has written a follow-up to his book Coder to Developer. Because of my <a href="":/entries/57">review</a> of that book, Mike was kind enough to send me a free copy of the new one.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214361X">Developer to Designer: <span class="caps">GUI</span> Design for the Busy Developer</a> focuses on designing good user interfaces for Microsoft Windows. So although this time there&#8217;s no .NET emphasis, if you&#8217;re looking for cross platform <span class="caps">GUI</span> design advice look elsewhere. In my opinion he&#8217;s made the right choice here &#8211; catering the various toolkits and desktop environments available for multiple platforms would make this book <span class="caps">HUGE</span>, and the human interface guidelines published by the various projects (e.g. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html">Apple</a> and <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></a>) would make such an effort largely redundant<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>As with Coder to Developer, this book is not a revelation &#8211; most of it&#8217;s content can be found elsewhere (not that Mike is a plagarist!). What he does do is distill this information into a very readable form, and presents clear examples of what does and doesn&#8217;t work in a <span class="caps">GUI</span>.  He also covers the basics of designing a web interface (although this is a subject in itself) and gives a preview of what&#8217;s coming in terms of UI design in Longhorn and Avalon.</p>


	<p>Although I found the book interesting, having now read it I probably wouldn&#8217;t have bought it for myself (not that I did of course), but I <strong>would</strong> recommend it (in fact I have) to both inexperienced and non-UI-focused developers. The former because it will set them on the right road, and the latter because people who don&#8217;t develop UIs on regular basis can make some <strong>very</strong> strange design choices and so this will help them get back on the right road.</p>


	<p>With this book &#8211; and its predecessor &#8211; Mike is doing a very good job of showing common development tasks and functions in an approachable way. Maybe not so valuable for experienced developers, but essential for the inexperienced, and I look forward to the next in the series (I&#8217;m assuming there will be one) if only to recommend it to colleagues and associates as I have done with these two.</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> As an aside, I would like to see a book on cross platform development with the <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ and/or QT (and other) toolkits. If anyone knows of one&#8230;</p>
