Recently, and probably unsurprisingly, I've been playing with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> and in particular the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ec2">Ubuntu Server beta</a>. So far I've been thoroughly impressed with its flexibility and power - especially the new management interface -  although I've not really explored beyond short lived test instances. I did wonder about migrating this server over to a long running instance, but my back-of-a-napkin calculations showed that I would be spending at least four times what I am currently paying for my <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a>.

Now Dustin Kirkland has made that job much easier using his <a href="http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/02/when-is-amazons-ec2-appropriate-for.html">ec2-cost utility in screen-profiles</a> (use the <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Escreen-profiles/+archive/ppa">PPA</a> if you're not on Jaunty). It can be used with screen-profiles, or used directly:

<pre>
$ /usr/share/screen-profiles/bin/ec2-cost  --detail

================================================
Estimated cost in Amazon's EC2 since last reboot
================================================
  Network sent:  0.420872 GB   @ $0.10/GB
  Network recv:  0.327810 GB   @ $0.17/GB
  Network cost:  0.104329
------------------------------------------------
  Uptime:        141 hr  @ $0.400000/hr
  Uptime cost:   $56.400000
------------------------------------------------
Total cost:      ~$56.50
================================================
</pre>

Hmm - $56.50 for 141 hours? Doesn't really compare to $19.95 for ~720 hours (+ lots of transfer) in an average month, but it won't stop me from using for short tasks/tests.

<strong>How much would you have spent?</strong>
