I've been involved with various organisations and charities over the past few years, and the two main problems they have all faced are:
<ol>
	<li>Lack of participation</li>
	<li>Dissemination of information</li>
</ol>
<span>Whilst 1) can only truly be overcome by having the right people, both <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> improved by collaboration - something which is tackled by many pieces of software.</span>

<span>A charitable organisation I run at the moment - an after school club at my children's school - suffers from both these problems, and one way we are seeking to <span class="hiddenSuggestion">address</span> them is by becoming a virtual or </span><em>shudder</em> <em>e</em>group. Physical meetings will always be required, but things like distributing minutes, drafting and review of documents etc. are perfect candidates for solving online.

<span>However the options on offer aren't that great. <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/apps/business/index.html">Google Apps</a> is the main one, but complete overkill for what we want which is a mailing list and document sharing/editing/review capabilities. Google Docs is perfect for the latter, but we don't really want hosted e-mail, calendar, chat etc. I know you can turn them off, but the mailing list <span class="hiddenSuggestion">requirement</span> still isn't met. Even if I keep e-mail enabled, people don't always want yet another e-mail <span class="hiddenSuggestion">address</span>/account to worry about.</span>

Personally I would just set up a wiki and mailing list and be done, but while this is perfect for a technical project e.g. software (that's how Ubuntu got started), there are more problems:
<ol>
	<li>(Lack of) technical knowledge</li>
	<li>Administration</li>
</ol>
Of course there's a learning curve to anything new. Google Docs gets rid of some of this by behaving in similar way to other applications, but it is still a new way of working. A wiki - although completely natural to me - will be completely alien to some if not all the other members. Compounding this problem is that I intend to step back from the organisation this autumn (after three years), and don't really want to remain as sysadmin.

Having written all this, I'm now coming to the conclusion that for this particular problem sticking to the old way is the best solution, but I'm still interested if  any decent (and hosted) solutions that help run groups exist, or if you help run a non-technical group (i.e. LUGs don't count!), what do you use?
