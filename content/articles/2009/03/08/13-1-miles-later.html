Remember I mentioned <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2009/02/12/run-against-the-machine">previously</a> about my "Delusions of Grandeur" having entered myself for a half marathon? Well, this time last week I was nursing aching muscles (and knees, and arches) having completed the <a href="http://www.edenrunners.co.uk/ourraces.htm">Haweswater Half Marathon</a> in <strong>2 hours 13 minutes and 10 seconds</strong>. I placed 477 out of 511 finishers, and 328 out of 342 males. However I never entered expecting to place particularly highly - I'm happy to a) finished it and b) finished it in a time better than I expected (based on my training runs, I expected to finish around 2:14 and I set myself a goal of 2:20).

The race atmosphere is fantastic, and the course itself was beautiful running alongside Haweswater. I'll definitely be entering another - I'm thinking about the <a href="http://www.keswickhalfmarathon.co.uk/">Keswick Half Marathon</a>, and considering the <a href="http://www.brathay.org.uk/default.aspx?l=2&p=93&t=52&h=brathay_windermere_marathon">Brathay Windermere Marathon</a>(!) over the next few months.

My longest training run before the race was 10.6 miles, so I was really feeling the last couple of miles, but I ran the majority of the race alongside a nice guy from Durham - John - who kept me going.

<strong>These Shoes Are Made For Running</strong>

I'd already been thinking about some new running shoes, but <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2009/02/12/run-against-the-machine#comment-11271">David's comment</a> reminded to actually do something about it, so I went to <a href="http://lakesrunner.com/">Lakes Runner</a> in Ambleside to do the whole gait analysis thing (apparently I'm neutral) and came away with a pair of <a href="http://www.brooksrunning.co.uk">Brooks</a> Glycerin 6 which are definitely more comfortable than my old Asics.

<strong>Let Down By Technology</strong>

Unfortunately my Garmin Forerunner 50 let me down 4.5 miles into the race, or rather the Footpod did, so I had no instant pace/distance readout and had to rely on the mile markers. Not a bad thing, but I did miss it. I believe it was the battery, because it has been working since I replaced it, but I don't believe I'd used it enough to drain the old one. Ho hum.

<strong>Lessons Learnt</strong>

<ol>
	<li>Structure my training more</li>
	<li>Ensure I've run the full race distance at least once</li>
	<li>Taper off more before a race</li>
	<li>Check my batteries!</li>
	<li>Blog about it in a timely fashion... :)<li>
