Since I got back from <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSJaunty/Report">UDS</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/gwibber">Gwibber</a> has been broken on my main machine. I knew it was something to do with WebKit, but I just didn't get around to looking any further into it until today.

...and I didn't have to look far - there's a <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/gwibber/+question/55250">question</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/gwibber/+bug/304033">bug</a> for exactly this problem, with a simple 2-step fix:

<ol>
	<li>Make sure you don't have the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~webkit-team">WebKit Team</a> <a href="https://launchpad.net/~webkit-team/+archive/ppa">PPA</a> enabled</li>
	<li>Make sure you downgrade the <code>libwebkit</code> package is version 1.0.1-2 (the default version in 8.10), not 1.0.1-4 (the WebKit Team version)</li>
</ol>

That's it - restart Gwibber, and it should be working again.
