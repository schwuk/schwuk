Being the "freedom-hating" person I am (Christmas saw the household iPod count rise to 4, plus various Apple related accessories, and I'm seriously considering a Shuffle for running and waiting to see if the Mac Mini is updated at MacWorld this week) I duly checked it out and there it was: &pound;6.32 for the full album, or 79p per track. It was also nice to see that they were only available as <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1711">iTunes Plus</a> (256kb AAC and DRM free).

Before I bought the album I decided to check out Amazon, and I was pleased to see that it's also availble through their MP3 download service from both the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001MYDM9E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=schwukcom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001MYDM9E">UK</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=schwukcom-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B001MYDM9E" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MFMEQK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=schwukcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MFMEQK">US</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schwukcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001MFMEQK" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> stores. This time the album was &pound;4.99 or 69p per track.

Since I've never tried Amazon's download service (and I'm a cheapskate!) I decided to go with them. A brief download/install of their helper application, the purchase of the album and subsequent download later and all was good. Very impressed, both with the price and the service. I'll be using them again.

Album review coming soon.
