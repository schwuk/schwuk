...and ice.

<em>(or why we invented treadmills.)</em>

I got up early (before 7AM!) this morning and went for a run. In the dark. The
first problem was that it was cold. Very cold. So I had about two extra layers
on top of my usual running gear. The second problem was that it was cold. Very
cold. This, combined with a warmish day yesterday, results in ice - both the
traditional and black variety. Imaginary traction control light kept going off
in my head! The third problem was that I took my (neurotic) dog Leo with me. I
thought I'd learnt my lesson about taking him, especially on a lead (essential),
but I thought the situation would be improved with the fancy extending lead we'd
bought over Christmas. I was wrong. You see the dogs like to run, but they also
like to stop. <strong>A lot.</strong> This means my pace gets shot. I thought
the extending lead would improve things, but in fact it just delays the
inevitable. Combine this with the black ice, and the adrenaline was sure pumping
by the time I got home! Lessons learnt: don't take the dog - it's just a bad
idea. Now traditionally I dive in at the deep end, push myself too hard, injure
or strain myself in some way and end up giving up running for a while, so this
morning - seeing as it's the first time I've run seriously since last September
- I deliberately took it easy: 1.41 miles in 14m 39s. <em>Very</em> slow
compared to my normal pace, but I'll blame that on the dog. And the ice. And I
was taking it easy. :) I'll repeat the same sort of distance for the next week
then start ramping it up again. In the meantime, I've got a real hankering for a
heart rate monitor...
