...yeah, right.

New Year resolutions and I have a chequered history, so my plan for this year is to "just do it" (and probably get sued for trademark infringement while I'm at it!).

One of the things I struggle with is procrastinating, and social networks are a great way to waste time. On the other hand, there's very few people I want to catch up with from school and I prefer the "old fashioned" tools of e-mail and RSS for keeping abreast of what my friends are up to, so without any further ado I have kissed goobye to:
<ul>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
Note that I have actually deleted the account, not just stopped using them.

identi.ca is on its way as well out as soon as I can figure out how to delete the account. You never know - dumping these might give me more time/inspiration for updating this site!

Happy New Year!
