I treated myself to a <a href="http://www.ghillie-kettle.co.uk/">Ghillie Kettle</a> (similar to a Kelly Kettle, but with a whistle) for Christmas gone from a group buy on <a href="http://bushcraftuk.com/">Bushcraft UK</a>. I've been meaning to write a post about it since, but <a href="http://bensbackwoods.blogspot.com/">Ben</a> has saved me the trouble with his <a href="http://bensbackwoods.blogspot.com/2009/02/ghille-kettle-review.html">post</a>.

Great pieces of kit.
