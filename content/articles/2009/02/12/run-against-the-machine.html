<em>The title of this post is based on the fact that I managed to dump the whole of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001I4K7F0?ie=UTF8&tag=schwukcom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B001I4K7F0">Rage Against The Machine</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=schwukcom-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B001I4K7F0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> album into my running playlist yesterday, but didn't realise until I'd actually started running. It was a very ... angry ... run!</em>

I thought I'd give a little update on my running progress.
<!--more-->
Since my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2009/01/24/its-hard-to-overstate-my-satisfaction">last running related post</a> I've been out only four times, for grand total of 16.8 miles. I've got exactly three excuses for this:

<ol>
	<li>I caught a cold, and I decided not to make it worse by running in the freezing weather we've been having recently</li>
	<li>I was in Berlin for the Jaunty sprint</li>
	<li>I got lazy</li>
</ol>

With regards to the first, I'm now consuming ridiculous amounts of Vitamin C to stave off future infections.

With regards to second, I did actually go running while I was there. Only once, though. :(

With regards to the third, it's amazing how easy it is to get out of the habit of exercising but at the same time get so frustrated because I was not...

<h3>Fitter, Faster, Further</h2>

When I started running again after Christmas, my average pace was 10:27 over 2 miles. Earlier this week I ran 4.7 (non-stop!) miles at an average of 9:36. Further and faster - result! My results yesterday weren't so good as my calves felt like lead for the first 2/3rds, but I got round in under 10 mins per mile so I happy(-ish).

<h3>Delusions Of Grandeur</h3>

In a fit of enthusiasm I've entered myself for two races in March:

<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.edenrunners.co.uk/ourraces.htm">Haweswater Half Marathon</a> on March 1st</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.grizedale10.co.uk/">Great Grizedale Trail Run</a> on March 29th</li>
</ul>

The half marathon really isn't that far away, so my training is quite intensive over the next two weeks. I'll worry about the trail run (which is only 10 miles) after that.

I have no illusions about where I'll place in either of these - I'll be happy just to finish.

<h3>Money Pit</h3>

It's often said that the only thing you need to enjoy running is a pair of trainers, and they're right - you can. However, as with all things, having good gear makes it more enjoyable.

Apart from my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000UW5SYG?ie=UTF8&tag=schwukcom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000UW5SYG">Garmin Forerunner 50</a> - which I'm loving - I've spent some money on a pair of <a href="https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/productdetail/id_product/28135">Salomon XA Raid Tights</a>, and yesterday a <a href="https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/productdetail/id_product/28135">Montane Featherlite Smock</a>.

The tights have made running in the cold much more comfortable - far better than wearing tracksuit bottoms - and the smock is incredible for it's weight: light, wind-proof, shower-proof and Fluorescent Yellow which comes in handy for running in bad light (or any time really).

Next on the list is a pair of lightweight (but warm) gloves, and a new pair of trainers. Probably a road/trail cross like the Salomon XT Wings.

In fact the cross thing is recurring theme - both the tights (with suitable underwear) smock, and watch are suitable for cycling, which I intend to get back into "real soon now". Not only for the cross training but because I plan to cycle clear across the country.

Oh, and I'm still hankering after a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0012XKD24?ie=UTF8&tag=schwukcom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0012XKD24">Forerunner 405</a>!
