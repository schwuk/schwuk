I'm still getting used to the quirks of developing with <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> on <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/">OS X</a> (I really need to finish my "Why I switched" post...), and the latest thing to trip me up was a) installing Python modules and b) install <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2/2.0.4">psycopg2</a> in particular.

Regarding a), I've now been enlightened after discovering the joys of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> (+ <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/">virtualenvwrapper</a> of course), <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">easy_install</a> and now <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>. Now pip - being the newer of the two and being virtualenv aware - is obviously better, but you still have to use easy_install to get it in the first place. virtualenv makes managing multiple projects with multiple versions of libraries (i.e. Django) sane, but overall I still get twitchy when installing applications - I miss apt-get and Synaptic!

<em>Yes, I know about Fink etc., but so far the experience with those has been suboptimal.</em>

For PostgreSQL, I went with the installer for 8.4 maintained over at <a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgdownload.do#osx">EnterpriseDB</a>. However when I tried to install psycopg2, I got an unhelpful message from both easy_install and pip about a file not being found, but not which file. A quick Google around led my to <a href="http://blog.jonypawks.net/2008/06/20/installing-psycopg2-on-os-x/">this post</a> which pointed me in the right direction. The trick is to provide pip (or easy_install) with the bin path for PostgreSQL. Therefore the magic incantation for me was:

<pre>
$ PATH=$PATH:/Library/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/ sudo pip install psycopg2
</pre>

<em>As an aside, I've been using <code>sudo</code> for years (and years), so why do I keep forgetting to use it with OS X?</em>

All working now!
