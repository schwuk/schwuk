I've been blogging (albeit sporadically) for quite a long time now, although not
so much recently. I use <a href="http://facebook.com/schwuk">Facebook</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.com/schwuk">tweet</a> a lot more these days, but the
stuff that doesn't fit into 140 characters rarely warrants a full blog post. The
second problem is the focus of this blog. Is it personal? Is it techy? Is it
fitness? The answer to all of these is yes, I've just done a poor job of
defining that. Finally I'm also getting sick on maintaining my
<a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> installation, and keeping a lone
<a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> instance around just for that (if I have a
choice, I use <a href="http://postgresql.com">PostgreSQL</a>). Finally, finally
a change is a good as a rest! :) I want to to do something to improve all of
these. First this blog is going to be retired, and this site (<a
    href="http://schwuk.com"
    >schwuk.com</a
>) will serve as a gateway to my other online presences (Facebook, Twitter, my
new blog etc.). Next up will be a new blog - hosted by
<a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> - which will be strictly limited to
topics that I find interesting at that point in time. So, anything really. :)
Stopping a blog is easy: turn it off and walk away. Retiring a blog is harder
since the intention is to keep the old content available. Retiring, relocating
and starting a new blog all in one go is an even bigger headache. This blog has
never won any awards for traffic, but there are still some popular pages which
is would be a shame to lose. My original plan was to just redirect this domain
to Tumblr, but that left me with no strategy for the old content. I briefly
considered migrating content across, but a) Tumblr has a different URL scheme to
WordPress which means b) I'd need to maintain redirects somewhere and c) I
wanted a blank sheet of paper. So my solution is divide and conquer. I'll
convert the old content into static HTML and host that in a subdomain of this
site, and use 301 redirects from here to the archive. The new blog will be under
another subdomain, which means I retain full control over this domain and where
I want to direct visitors to. Should be an interesting experiment...
