After not running at all (discounting a couple of goes on the jogging in <a title="Wii Fit" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000VJRU44?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=schwukcom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000VJRU44" target="_blank">Wii Fit</a>!) for <strong>5 whole weeks</strong>, I finally stopped making excuses and made the most of our good weather for a 4.5 miler today and - surprisingly - I'm still in reasonable shape. I ran only slightly slower that I did in my <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2009/03/08/13-1-miles-later">half marathon</a> - which I blame entirely on having to wait for the dog to catch me up every so often :) - with only a couple of stops and one brief walk. Not bad IMO.

Now to keep up the training and look for some races post-<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic" target="_blank">UDS</a>.

The reason for my break in training - which resulted in me skipping my second planned race - was that I was waiting for my new tattoo to heal. I've only recently (i.e. the last year-and-a-bit) started getting tattooed (any comments about a mid-life crisis will be directed to <code>/dev/null</code> :) - but it's true what they say: it's extremely addictive. I've already got about 4 more planned!

The tattoo I've had done is a stylised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Ra" target="_blank">Eye Of Ra</a>, also known as the Eye of Horus. The design comes from <a href="http://www.tattootribes.com/index.php?idinfo=828" target="_blank">Tattoo Tribes</a>, and the basic meaning is protection although there are lots of other interpretations and meanings. I also have a few personal reasons for using this particular symbol.
