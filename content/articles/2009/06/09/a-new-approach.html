Although I've previously mastered (some) distance in my running, my speed was distinctly average at a pace of 10:10.

Over the past couple of months my running has been patchy with the odd illness, general apathy, new tattoos (I'm up to five now), and - most recently - UDS Karmic and AllHands.

But yesterday seemed like a good day to start again, and I repeated it again today. Instead of my usual route of 4.6 miles, I opted for a shorter one of 2.4 miles and pushed myself. So far my average pace is 08:53 - a big improvement. I'll keep going at this pace/distance until I can do it comfortably (or even faster), then add some more miles on.

It's made me realise how much I missed running though.
