Messing around with the Summarize service in OS X, I got the following result:
<blockquote>I like to think of it this way: Twitter is a bunch of friends sitting around a table, all shouting at the same time — and shouting mundanities at that.</blockquote>
<!--more-->

The summary came from this paragraph:
<blockquote>To proceed: the “this context” I mentioned above is simply that tweets are broadcast indiscriminately. I think this further devalues them; an otherwise acceptable message (”Brunch at Hi-Spot at 1!”) becomes impersonal and meaningless when it’s sent to so many. Yes, there is @ for specifying another tweet or Twitterer (would that they had called the site something else, this accursed bird-based jargon drives me mad), but that just exacerbates things. I like to think of it this way: Twitter is a bunch of friends sitting around a table, all shouting at the same time — and shouting mundanities at that. The @ function just means you shout somebody’s name before the mundanity. Everyone else still has to listen. Conversation is impossible; every exchange is telegraphic (as is, unfortunately, increasingly true in other media).</blockquote>
Which came from the article <a title="Read the &quot;Why I Don't Use Twitter&quot; article" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/17/why-i-dont-use-twitter/">Why I Don't Use Twitter</a> on TechCrunch.

The summary is pretty succinct I think. :)
