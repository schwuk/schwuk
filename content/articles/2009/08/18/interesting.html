Messing around with the Summarize service in OS X, I got the following result:
<blockquote>
    I like to think of it this way: Twitter is a bunch of friends sitting around
    a table, all shouting at the same time — and shouting mundanities at that.
</blockquote>

The summary came from this paragraph:
<blockquote>
    To proceed: the “this context” I mentioned above is simply that tweets are
    broadcast indiscriminately. I think this further devalues them; an otherwise
    acceptable message (”Brunch at Hi-Spot at 1!”) becomes impersonal and
    meaningless when it’s sent to so many. Yes, there is @ for specifying
    another tweet or Twitterer (would that they had called the site something
    else, this accursed bird-based jargon drives me mad), but that just
    exacerbates things. I like to think of it this way: Twitter is a bunch of
    friends sitting around a table, all shouting at the same time — and shouting
    mundanities at that. The @ function just means you shout somebody’s name
    before the mundanity. Everyone else still has to listen. Conversation is
    impossible; every exchange is telegraphic (as is, unfortunately,
    increasingly true in other media).

Which came from the article

    href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/17/why-i-dont-use-twitter/"
    >Why I Don't Use Twitter</a

on TechCrunch. The summary is pretty succinct I think. :)
