<p>I was chatting to <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org">Jono</a> on <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> (see my <a href="/static/5/contact">contact details</a> is you want to &#8216;ring&#8217; me) earlier about various things and we got onto the topic of <a href="http://mono-project.com/">Mono</a>.</p>


	<p>We discussed the possibility of me being on the next <a href="http://www.lugradio.org">LugRadio</a> show to discuss it, and we both said we would go and do some research on it.</p>


	<p>We were also discussing my first &#8216;<a href="http://www.cumbria.lug.org.uk/index.php?id=6">article</a>&#8217;  as I&#8217;d asked him for some advice on my writing and getting published. He recommended that I submit links to my pieces on places like <a href="http://www.newsforge.com">NewsForge</a> and <a href="http://oreillynet.com/">O&#8217;Reilly</a> so off I went to do just that&#8230;</p>


	<p>So, I land at <a href="http://www.newsforge.com">NewsForge</a>, and what do I find? An article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://os.newsforge.com/os/04/07/13/1620239.shtml?tid=2&#38;tid=51&#38;tid=52&#38;tid=140">The downlow on Mono</a>&#8221; on the frontpage and a link to another Mono article in NewsVac entitled &#8220;<a href="http://news.com.com/2008-7344_3-5271084.html">More than an open-source curiosity</a>&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Next on <a href="http://www.osdir.com/">OSDir</a> I found a link to the current <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a> column <a href="http://arstechnica.com/etc/linux/">Linux.Ars</a> (dodgy name if ever there was one!) subtitled &#8220;Mono Ã¢?? a unified development platform&#8221;.</p>


	<p>So, is today Mono day or what?</p>


	<p>P.S. I&#8217;ve submitted my <a href="http://www.cumbria.lug.org.uk/index.php?id=6">&#8216;Introduction to Screen&#8217; article</a> to both <a href="http://newsvac.newsforge.com/">NewsForge Newsvac</a> and <a href="http://www.osdir.com/">OSDir</a> &#8211; hopefully they&#8217;ll make it through&#8230;</p>
