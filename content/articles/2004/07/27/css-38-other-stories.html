<p>For the unobservant amongst you, I have modified the layout of the site. I&#8217;ve used the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/">faux columns</a> and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins/">negative margins</a> tricks from <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> to get things looking the way I want. I&#8217;ve tested in in Firefox 0.9 (Windows &#38; Linux), Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0, and Opera 7.53 (Linux) so far, and everything seems to be working&#8230; I&#8217;ve learnt a lot about <span class="caps">CSS</span> and cross-browser compatibility today!</p>


	<h3>An Internet Explorer to suit your mood</h3>


	<p>One thing I used whilst testing the design was <a href="http://www.insert-title.com/web_design/?page=articles/dev/multi_IE">Multiple IE&#8217;s in Windows</a> &#8211; makes testing sooo much easier.</p>


	<h3>Sci-Fi</h3>


	<p>Never really been a big fan of the Sci-Fi genre of fiction, but after re-reading my Carl Hiassen and J.K.Rowling books for the umpteenth time I decided it was time to try something new&#8230;</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve just finished <a href="http://craphound.com/down">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a> and currently reading <a href="http://craphound.com/est/">Eastern Standard Tribe</a> by <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>. I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised by them. I think it&#8217;s because they aren&#8217;t too far fetched &#8211; they&#8217;re simply two steps beyond where we currently are &#8211; that make them so palatable.</p>


	<p>I may have to try some more like this&#8230;</p>
