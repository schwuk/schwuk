<p>Got this one via <a href="http://www.ppcw.net/?itemid=2014">Pocket PC Wireless.net</a> &#8211; it appears that Microsoft (or <span class="caps">MSN</span> rather) have a browser based <span class="caps">MSN</span> Messenger in <a href="http://webmessenger.msn.com/">beta</a>. Fairly cool in itself, but to my surprise it works under Firefox on Linux &#8211; very impressive!</p>

	<p>Just goes to show you don&#8217;t need to use ActiveX to get fancy applications in a web browser.</p>


	<h3>Other stories&#8230;</h3>


	<p>A few updates to the site&#8230;</p>


	<p>First up is that I&#8217;ve ditched the banners that were based on photos from <a href="http://openphoto.net/">OpenPhoto.Net</a> &#8211; a good resource for royalty free images if you need them &#8211; instead I&#8217;ve started using my own photos. I was browsing through them last night and decided that some of them were good enough to use, so&#8230;</p>


	<p>The banners are rotated at random &#8211; you can keep hitting refresh or look <a href="/static/13/banners">here</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve also added a <a href="/static/14/colophon">colophon</a>. If you&#8217;re wondering what that is:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>A statement found at the end of a book. A colophon may give information about the typography and printing methods used in the book or may serve as a statement of printing limitation.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I&#8217;ve noticed them on various sites (notably <a href="http://1976design.com/blog/colophon/">Dunstan Orchards blog</a>) in place of the typical &#8220;about me&#8221; or &#8220;about this site&#8221; pages and decided to put one here.</p>
