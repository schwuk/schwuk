<p>This site is the work of David Murphy (aka Schwuk).</p>

	<h3>About me</h3>


	<p>I am an Engineer for a international IT company. My main role software development with a large side order of architecture. I also do some freelance consultancy, design, development and writing.</p>


	<p>I am skilled in .NET development, Perl, <span class="caps">SQL</span>, PHP etc. I have a healthy interest in all things technical and computer related, especially Linux. I am the co-ordinator for the <a href="http://www.cumbria.lug.org.uk">Cumbria Linux User Group</a>.</p>


	<p>I am currently <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/mcp/mcp/">certified</a> in Microsoft .NET Web Applications and Web Services, and working towards my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/mcp/mcad/"><span class="caps">MCAD</span></a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/mcp/mcsd/"><span class="caps">MCSD</span></a> certifications.</p>


	<h3>Powered by&#8230;</h3>


	<p>This site is powered by the <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>, which is an incredibly flexible publishing system for people who want control over their content and layout.</p>


	<p>It is hosted on my own server, which is provided by <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> whom I wholeheartedly recommend if you are looking for your own server.</p>


	<p>The server is running <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com">Fedora Core 1</a> which is a damn fine Linux distro (of course Fedora Core 2 is better).</p>


	<h3>Styled by&#8230;</h3>


	<p>Me of course!</p>


	<p>All layout is done with <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and all markup should be <span class="caps">XHTML 1</span>.0 Strict. Textpattern breaks this though&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Banners</h3>


	<p>The banners visible at the top of every page are rotated by a small <a href="http://www.php.net"><span class="caps">PHP</span></a> script. Sometimes you&#8217;ll get the same, sometimes you wont&#8230;</p>


	<p>The images used in the banners are my own. They are sections of interest taken from larger images. You can view a full list of the <a href="/static/13/banners">banners</a> if you like.</p>


	<p>At the moment, all image manipulation is done with <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the <span class="caps">GIMP</span></a> running under <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com">Fedora Core 2</a>.</p>
