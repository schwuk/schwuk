title: The trouble with XP SP2
tags:

<p>
    I&#8217;ve been reading a few
    <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5443">posts</a> about how
    <em>bad</em> XP <span class="caps">SP2</span> is &#8211; &#8220;it breaks
    applications&#8221; &#8211; and how companies like
    <span class="caps">IBM</span> (and my own) and placing a hold on deploying
    <span class="caps">SP2</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The company bit I understand &#8211; as will every other person who has
    worked for a medium-to-large company &#8211; as there are serious logistics
    involved in deploying patches like this in a sensible fashion.
</p>

<p>
    As for the people complaining about it breaking applications &#8211; do they
    not understand that the basic principle of a firewall is to block traffic,
    and a good firewall should block by default? I mean, it&#8217;s not exactly
    hard to unblock the ports you require is it? Even Microsoft&#8217;s own
    <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=842242"
        >knowledge base article</a
    >
    about it basically just tells you to unblock the ports&#8230;
</p>

<p><em>/me shakes head&#8230;</em></p>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/915">Jonathan Hassell</a> gets it
    right in his
    <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5436">O&#8217;Reilly blog</a>
    &#8211; this sums his post up nicely:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        <span class="caps">SP2</span> does break software, but it breaks
        software that was doing security wrong.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t agree more&#8230;</p>
