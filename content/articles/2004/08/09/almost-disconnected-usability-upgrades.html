title: (Almost) disconnected usability upgrades

<p>The title isn&#8217;t as strange as it sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s actually three topics:</p>


	<h3>(Almost) disconnected</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m now back at my computer after a weeks holiday. A nice break which was intended to be fully disconnected, but a deadline moved forward so I had to borrow my brother-in-law&#8217;s iBook to quickly re-work a website.</p>


	<h3>Usability</h3>


	<p>I have lusted after Apple computers since the original iMac came out. The release of <span class="caps">OS X</span>, and subsequent hardware and software releases have simply increased this desire.</p>


	<p>So, I want a Mac. I <em>need</em> a Mac. But I&#8217;ve never used a Mac!</p>


	<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve played with them in PC World, but I&#8217;ve never really <em>used</em> one. Last week was the first time I&#8217;ve used both a Apple iBook and <span class="caps">OS X</span> (10.3) in anger, and to a certain extent I found it lacking.</p>


	<p>Everyone raves about the usability of Macs, but for a long-term Microsoft Windows and Linux user they really are quite strange. I got over most of the strangeness (right-clicking, the menus etc.) in fairly short order, but once I was back home and using my Fedora Core 2 machine again I was truly happy. <span class="caps">OS X</span> has lots of nice touches &#8211; like Expose &#8211; and I could see myself getting used to using it, but..</p>


	<p>The question is: Do I still want a Mac?</p>


	<p>...</p>


	<p>Of course I do! :)</p>


	<h3>Upgrades</h3>


	<p>Both <a href="http://www.understated.co.uk/blog/">Matthew Revell</a> and <a href="http://blog.westmids.biz/">Sparkes</a> of <a href="http://www.lugradio.org">LugRadio</a> have updated and upgraded their blogs recently. Both have gone with &#8216;off the shelf&#8217; blog software (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> &#38; <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> respectively), both are using <span class="caps">XHTML</span> (only  Sparkes&#8217; validates though) and both are using <span class="caps">CSS</span> layouts. Good work all round!</p>


	<p>Spakes&#8217; moving from a custom blog to WordPress raised a question with me. I have absolutely no evidence to back this up, but it seems that more <em>technical</em> people are moving away from custom <span class="caps">CMS</span>/Blogs to &#8216;off the shelf&#8217; ones. I&#8217;ve no idea what reasons they are using, but mine was simply because I had better things to do than tweak site engines all day.</p>
