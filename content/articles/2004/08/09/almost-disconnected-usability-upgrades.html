title: (Almost) disconnected usability upgrades

<p>
    The title isn&#8217;t as strange as it sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s actually
    three topics:
</p>

<h3>(Almost) disconnected</h3>

<p>
    I&#8217;m now back at my computer after a weeks holiday. A nice break which
    was intended to be fully disconnected, but a deadline moved forward so I had
    to borrow my brother-in-law&#8217;s iBook to quickly re-work a website.
</p>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>
    I have lusted after Apple computers since the original iMac came out. The
    release of <span class="caps">OS X</span>, and subsequent hardware and
    software releases have simply increased this desire.
</p>

<p>So, I want a Mac. I <em>need</em> a Mac. But I&#8217;ve never used a Mac!</p>

<p>
    Yes, I&#8217;ve played with them in PC World, but I&#8217;ve never really
    <em>used</em> one. Last week was the first time I&#8217;ve used both a Apple
    iBook and <span class="caps">OS X</span> (10.3) in anger, and to a certain
    extent I found it lacking.
</p>

<p>
    Everyone raves about the usability of Macs, but for a long-term Microsoft
    Windows and Linux user they really are quite strange. I got over most of the
    strangeness (right-clicking, the menus etc.) in fairly short order, but once
    I was back home and using my Fedora Core 2 machine again I was truly happy.
    <span class="caps">OS X</span> has lots of nice touches &#8211; like Expose
    &#8211; and I could see myself getting used to using it, but..
</p>

<p>The question is: Do I still want a Mac?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Of course I do! :)</p>

<h3>Upgrades</h3>

<p>
    Both <a href="http://www.understated.co.uk/blog/">Matthew Revell</a> and
    <a href="http://blog.westmids.biz/">Sparkes</a> of
    <a href="http://www.lugradio.org">LugRadio</a> have updated and upgraded
    their blogs recently. Both have gone with &#8216;off the shelf&#8217; blog
    software (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> &#38;
    <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> respectively), both are using
    <span class="caps">XHTML</span> (only Sparkes&#8217; validates though) and
    both are using <span class="caps">CSS</span> layouts. Good work all round!
</p>

<p>
    Spakes&#8217; moving from a custom blog to WordPress raised a question with
    me. I have absolutely no evidence to back this up, but it seems that more
    <em>technical</em> people are moving away from custom
    <span class="caps">CMS</span>/Blogs to &#8216;off the shelf&#8217; ones.
    I&#8217;ve no idea what reasons they are using, but mine was simply because
    I had better things to do than tweak site engines all day.
