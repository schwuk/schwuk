<p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to uploading the archive of <a href="http://www.schwuk.com/archives/spp/">Schwuk&#8217;s Playstation Page</a> &#8211; a prior incarnation of this site. My reasons for doing this are two-fold:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>I want to remind myself a) how bad my web design skills were and b) why frames are bad</li>
		<li>I&#8217;m sick of the 404&#8217;s showing up in my logs&#8230;</li>
	</ol>


	<p>One day I may get around to dumping the content into another format so that it at least looks good!</p>
