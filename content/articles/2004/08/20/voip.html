<p>Just a brief<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> comment on VoIP &#8211; <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/149">Nathan Torkington</a> blogs about his <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5415">First steps in VoIP</a>. In it he mentions <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> which frequent readers (if I have any) will know I&#8217;ve used quite a bit.</p>


	<p>He wanted VoIP so that he could communicate with his family back home whilst on trips. At the moment I&#8217;ve mainly used it to communicate with family abroad instead of spending money on phone calls, and it works admirably well for this &#8211; as Skype say on their website:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Better sound quality than your regular phone</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...and it&#8217;s true &#8211; a call to Australia sound better on Skype than they do on BT!</p>


	<p>The trouble with VoIP is too many options. As well as Skype<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.xten.com/index.php?menu=products&#38;smenu=xlite">X-Lite</a> (as mentioned by Nathan in his blog), <a href="http://www.linspire.com">Linspire</a> have released the <a href="http://phonegaim.com/">PhoneGaim</a> plugin for <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim</a>, and of course you can use <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/"><span class="caps">MSN</span> Messenger</a> for voice calls &#8211; except I could never get <span class="caps">MSN</span> to work with firewall, and Skype worked out of the box. By no means an exhaustive list, but a start&#8230;</p>


	<p>I think VoIP definitely has a place in the modern internet, and as broadband<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> becomes more ubiquitous there will be a greater emphasis on using it.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Okay, it ended up not being that brief!</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Skype have recently released version 1.0 for <a href="http://www.skype.com/download.html">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href="http://www.skype.com/download_pda.html">Pocket PC</a>, and 0.91 for <a href="http://www.skype.com/download_linux.html">Linux</a>.</p>


	<p id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> I&#8217;ve finally got a date for <span class="caps">ADSL</span>! 15/12/2004 &#8211; w00t!</p>
