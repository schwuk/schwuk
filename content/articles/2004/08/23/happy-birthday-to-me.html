<p>Well, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m offically 30.</p>


	<p>My wife arranged for my friend Mat and I to spend the day sailing, windsurfing, and kayaking at <a href="http://www.nicholendmarine.co.uk/">Nichol End</a> on Derwentwater. A very enjoyable day, and a hearty recommendation for the owner Nick who is a fantastic character. Mat has now been bitten by the watersports bug, and is busy planning his first sailing course!</p>


	<p>My sister-in-law sent me a <a href="http://www.akubra.com.au/products_country.html">Territory</a> hat from Akubra. An authentic Australian bush hat!</p>


	<p>Amazon vouchers from my parents have funded <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596007922/026-8776494-0322042">a</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214327X/026-8776494-0322042">few</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590171/026-8776494-0322042">additions</a> to my ever-growing library.</p>


	<p>Wisely chosen (with help from their mother) PC World vouchers from my kids, plus other birthday money have now been converted into a <a href="http://www.pikaone.com/en/products/dvd_dual.htm"><span class="caps">DVD RW</span> drive</a> &#8211; I&#8217;ve finally joined the <span class="caps">DVD</span> revolution, having limped along with a 40x <span class="caps">CD ROM</span> for years. I&#8217;m still experimenting with creating actual <span class="caps">DVD</span> movies, but I can finally backup my media (audio, video, and photo) collections.</p>


	<p>Time to upgrade my computer (especially the storage) though!</p>
