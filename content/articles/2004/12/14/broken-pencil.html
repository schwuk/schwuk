<p>Without conscious decision, I&#8217;ve started reading eBooks (again) on my Palm Vx. Recently I&#8217;ve gotten through:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://craphound.com/down/">Down and Out in the Magical Kingdom</a> by <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://craphound.com/est/">Eastern Standard Tribe</a> by the same</li>
		<li><a href="http://craphound.com/place/">A Place So Foreign and Eight More</a> also by Cory</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/index.html">Free as in Freedom</a> By Sam Williams via <a href="http://www.plkr.org/">Plucker</a></li>
		<li>Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, via <a href="http://www.chuggnutt.com/ebooks.php">chuggnutt.com</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>And I&#8217;ve got a bunch more queued up.</p>


	<p>Part of the reason I find myself liking eBooks now is the same as <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/11118.aspx">Rory</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>If I get caught in line for too long somewhere, I can read a few lines of Shakespeare or go over another T.S. Eliot[sic] poem, trying to figure out what in the hell it is that he&#8217;s trying to say behind all the words that he so expertly put down.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Ok, not quite that <em>intellectual</em>, but because I have the book(s) in my pocket, I find myself reading more often. eBooks are a convenient format.</p>


	<h3>The art of the con</h3>


	<p>Watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/">Catch Me If You Can</a> last night. It&#8217;s an entertaining adaption of the book about and by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Abagnale">Frank Abagnale</a>. As <a href="/entries/20">usual</a> this left me thirsting for more, so off a googling I went.</p>


	<p>First stop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Abagnale">Wikipedia</a>, then his official <a href="http://www.abagnale.com/">site</a>, then the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1587244365">book</a> itself. Then the realisation I was currently reading Tom Sawyer on my handheld, so why not this as well? A quick browse of various eBook retailers, and I landed at the door of <a href="http://www.ereader.com/">eReader.com</a>.</p>


	<h3>The titular pencil</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been aware of, and used, this service since its original incarnation as Peanut Press (later Palm Digital Media and now eReader) but it&#8217;s been a while since I last visited.</p>


	<p>Hmm, lots of interesting books. They do wishlists &#8211; cool. Let&#8217;s set one up. Now let&#8217;s link to it like I do my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/registry/wishlist/202-1323059-3101402">Amazon one</a>.</p>


	<p>Ah.</p>


	<p>It would appear that:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>You need to be logged in to view your wishlist</li>
		<li>You cannot view anyone else&#8217;s wishlist, and hence you cannot buy anyone books from their wishlist (apart from giving them a <a href="http://www.ereader.com/giftcertificate/about">gift certificate</a>)</li>
	</ol>


	<p>So unless I&#8217;ve missed something completely obvious, it&#8217;s a personal shopping list that is, in the words of Sir Edmund Blackadder:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>like a broken pencil&#8230;pointless</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Aside from the <em>pointless</em> wishlist, I&#8217;ve found eReader to be a fairly complete and easy to use service, and their range of books have greatly increased since their early days. I look forward to reading more eBooks, and I may have to try out some of the other <a href="http://mobipocket.com/">retailers</a> as well.</p>
