<p>One of my christmas presents was a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/start/buy/">Xbox Live starter kit</a> which includes a headset, three demos and 12 months subscription.</p>


	<p>All I can say is that Microsoft have put a <strong>lot</strong> of thought into the whole &#8216;live&#8217; experience. Everything from registration to finding and playing a game is slick and painless.</p>


	<p>See you online!</p>
