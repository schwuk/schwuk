<p>Since getting my <span class="caps">ADSL</span>, I&#8217;ve been using Windows XP as my primary OS. I spent a few hours this morning trying to get my <a href="http://www.speedtouch.com/produsb.htm">SpeedTouch <span class="caps">USB</span></a> (also known as &#8216;the frog&#8217;) to work under Linux.</p>


	<p>No joy.</p>


	<p>None.</p>


	<p>Whatsoever.</p>


	<p>:(</p>


	<p>It appears that the Speedtouch package available in universe somewhat ironically requires an internet connection to retrieve. D&#8217;oh!</p>


	<p>I also tried the <a href="http://s1x.homelinux.net/projects/speedtouch_suite">Speedtouch Suite</a> but I&#8217;m getting errors from modprobe, and I&#8217;m not sure how to resolve them.</p>


	<p>Why don&#8217;t these things <strong>Just Work&#8482;</strong>?</p>


	<p>Before I hear cries of &#8220;Hardware Modem&#8221; this is a standard piece of hardware that a) has been around for awhile now and b) is distributed by most ISPs.</p>


	<p>I will be upgrading to a separate gateway, but for now my primary OS is once again XP (albeit running <span class="caps">FOSS</span> software).</p>
