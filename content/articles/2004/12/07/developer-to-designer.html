	<p>The author of <a href="/entries/30">Coder to Developer</a> &#8211; <a href="http://larkware.com/">Mike Gunderloy</a> &#8211;  is releasing a new book:</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.sybex.com/sybexbooks.nsf/2604971535a28b098825693d0053081b/b9193df2e1e391fa88256e70005ad6be!OpenDocument">Developer to Designer: <span class="caps">GUI</span> Design for the Busy Developer</a> which promises to be:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>A unique resource designed to help you and other experienced developers build GUIs for your programs that are simple to learn, easy to use, and painless to maintain, even though youâ??re not user interface experts. Inside, the focus is on the essentials of Windows and web <span class="caps">GUI</span> design: simple ideas that require modest programming effort but provide enormous payoffs in terms of user success and satisfaction.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Sounds interesting&#8230;</p>


	<p>No idea if it will have the same .NET slant as the previous one (which Mike has told me will be addressed in a revised edition which extends the scope of the book to cover <acronym title="Linux Apache MySQL <span class="caps">PHP</span>/Perl/Python">LAMP</acronym> and Java development), which I felt limited its audience. This was a shame as I felt many people could learn from it.</p>
