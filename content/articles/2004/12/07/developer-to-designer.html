	<p>The author of <a href="/entries/30">Coder to Developer</a> &#8211; <a href="http://larkware.com/">Mike Gunderloy</a> &#8211;  is releasing a new book:</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.sybex.com/sybexbooks.nsf/2604971535a28b098825693d0053081b/b9193df2e1e391fa88256e70005ad6be!OpenDocument">Developer to Designer: <span class="caps">GUI</span> Design for the Busy Developer</a> which promises to be:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>A unique resource designed to help you and other experienced developers build GUIs for your programs that are simple to learn, easy to use, and painless to maintain, even though you√¢??re not user interface experts. Inside, the focus is on the essentials of Windows and web <span class="caps">GUI</span> design: simple ideas that require modest programming effort but provide enormous payoffs in terms of user success and satisfaction.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Sounds interesting&#8230;</p>


	<p>No idea if it will have the same .NET slant as the previous one (which Mike has told me will be addressed in a revised edition which extends the scope of the book to cover <acronym title="Linux Apache MySQL <span class="caps">PHP</span>/Perl/Python">LAMP</acronym> and Java development), which I felt limited its audience. This was a shame as I felt many people could learn from it.</p>
