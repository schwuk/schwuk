<p>Following on from my entry <a href="/entries/55">Don&#8217;t underestimate the value of a good debugger</a>,,,</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not really following your conclusion here. Are you saying that your Mono development environment isn&#8217;t as good as Visual Studio (because it&#8217;s absent a debugger), which is what the article appears to imply for 90% of it? Or do you mean that IDEs aren&#8217;t necessary and your Mono development environment is as good as an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; <span class="caps">IDE</span> like VS (as the last paragraph seems to suggest)?</p>

	<p>Both.</p>


	<p>My current Mono development environment <strong>is</strong> inferior to Visual Studio .NET  because it&#8217;s missing an <strong>integrated</strong> debugger, but an <span class="caps">IDE</span> does not a coder make.</p>


	<p>To me it&#8217;s an evolution of my programming skills. I learnt Delphi<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and Perl<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> via an <span class="caps">IDE</span>. I started learning .NET via the <span class="caps">SDK</span>, but only really got to grips with it when I started using the <span class="caps">IDE</span>. Now I&#8217;m using Mono, I find I no longer need the <span class="caps">IDE</span> &#8211; I regarded it as essential, but now it&#8217;s just nice to have.</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Not that you have much choice with Delphi &#8211; you have to buy the <span class="caps">IDE</span> to get the compiler, so you may as well use it.</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Via <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">ActiveState Komodo</a> &#8211; and excellent multi-language <span class="caps">IDE</span> based on Mozilla. I relied on it for the integrated debugger whilst learning, but I have weaned myself off it now.</p>
