<p>
    Due to my lack of broadband, I got my <span class="caps">ADSL</span>-enabled
    friend to download the Ubuntu install CD for me. He delivered it last night,
    and I attempted to <a href="/entries/47/ubuntu-ubuntu">install today</a>...
</p>

<p>
    Not good &#8211; CD was truncated, and I blew away my
    <span class="caps">FC2</span> install for Ubuntu. Not good at all.
</p>

<p>
    Since re-downloading was not an option, I decided to see if I could
    &#8216;repair&#8217; the CD.
</p>

<p>Bear with me &#8211; it&#8217;s not as daft as it sounds&#8230;</p>

<p>
    Enter <a href="http://atterer.net/jigdo/">Jigsaw Download</a> or jigdo to
    its friends. Jigdo downloads an <span class="caps">ISO</span>
    <strong>file by file</strong>. You can also use it to patch or repair an
    existing <span class="caps">ISO</span> by telling it to pull valid files
    from the CD/ISO and retrieve the rest from the &#8216;net. How cool is that?
</p>

<p>So I now have a working install CD, and a working intall of Ubuntu!</p>
