<p>I said in my review of <a href="entries/30/book-review-coder-to-developer">Coder to Developer</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>My only real criticism is that when discussing various tools to help with the various tasks, the emphasis is placed on the authorâ??s favourite commercial tools over the Free/Open alternatives. While this may suit some people, I disagreed with it and made me feel as though parts of the book are more advert than advice.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>There now seems to be the book I was hoping for &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321228103">Open Source .Net Development: Programming with NAnt, NUnit, NDoc, and More</a> (it&#8217;s on my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/registry/wishlist/202-1323059-3101402">wishlist</a> if someone wants to treat me!). If this book is as good as I hope it is, then I will be buying copies for the other developers on my team.</p>


	<p>My only comment (without reading the book) is:</p>


	<p>Do they mean &#8220;Developing Open Source with .NET&#8221; or &#8220;Developing .NET with Open Source&#8221;? Hopefully it&#8217;s both&#8230;</p>
