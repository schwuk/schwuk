    I said in my review of
    <a href="entries/30/book-review-coder-to-developer">Coder to Developer</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        My only real criticism is that when discussing various tools to help
        with the various tasks, the emphasis is placed on the author√¢??s
        favourite commercial tools over the Free/Open alternatives. While this
        may suit some people, I disagreed with it and made me feel as though
        parts of the book are more advert than advice.

    There now seems to be the book I was hoping for &#8211;
    <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321228103"
        >Open Source .Net Development: Programming with NAnt, NUnit, NDoc, and
        More</a
    >
    (it&#8217;s on my
    <a

    if someone wants to treat me!). If this book is as good as I hope it is,
    then I will be buying copies for the other developers on my team.
</p>

<p>My only comment (without reading the book) is:</p>

<p>
    Do they mean &#8220;Developing Open Source with .NET&#8221; or
    &#8220;Developing .NET with Open Source&#8221;? Hopefully it&#8217;s
    both&#8230;
