title: Don't underestimate the value of a good debugger

<p>This morning I followed a trail of breadcrumbs&#8230;</p>


	<p>Aq <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/11/29/idesmarch">pointed</a> me  at Simon&#8217;s <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/11/27/eclipse">complaint</a> about downloading <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and Ned&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/20041128T190631.html">comments</a> about just writing code, which led me to Oliver&#8217;s <a href="http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides">The <span class="caps">IDE</span> Divide</a> and Bob&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bobcongdon.net/blog/2004/11/dividing-developer-world.html">response</a>.</p>


	<p>As stated numerous times, I am a big fan of Visual Studio .NET, as I believe it makes me faster. This is because of its:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Syntax Hightlighting</li>
		<li>Documentation (especially inline)</li>
		<li>Code completion (to a lesser extent)</li>
		<li>Visual Debugging</li>
	</ul>


	<p>The last entry on that list is my main reason for using an <span class="caps">IDE</span>. Being able to step through <strong>my</strong> code, set breakpoints, evaluate/modify variables and see exceptions <strong>as they happen</strong> is worth the money (or not as the case may be) to me. Combined, all of the features make me a faster developer, but it&#8217;s manual debugging and minor syntax errors that really slow me down.</p>


	<p>Since really getting into <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> coding, I&#8217;ve mainly been using <a href="http://www.vim.org/" class="g">vim</a> and <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/">gedit</a> combined with Monodoc and the command line Mono tools instead of <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>. Part of this is habit &#8211; MonoDevelop was slow and unreliable under my old <span class="caps">FC2</span> install &#8211; and part of it is that it doesn&#8217;t add a huge amount of benefit if you are used to using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">make</a> (which I even use for Delphi projects on Windows!). But if it had a built-in visual debugger, it would be top of my list.</p>


	<p>In the past I was (to use Oliver&#8217;s terminology) a tool maven &#8211; I would hop from <span class="caps">IDE</span> to <span class="caps">IDE</span>, try plugins to get the most out them, and choose my languages based on their <span class="caps">IDE</span> (which is why I never really got into JavaScript). These days they&#8217;re just electric screwdrivers to me &#8211; they do the job faster, but you don&#8217;t need them.</p>
