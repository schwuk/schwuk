<p>One of the things that frustrates me with the Microsoft/.NET communities is the willingness to pay (and charge) for things. I&#8217;m not talking Visual Studio .NET here, but rather simple little tools that may (or may not) make your life easier &#8211; Text editors<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, Winzip-alikes<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> or <a href="http://www.desaware.com/products/universalnet/ntservicetoolkit/index.aspx">utilities</a> that replicate built-in functionality that people are too lazy to learn/use/</p>


	<p>Another thing that annoys me is the herd mentality of said communities. There are some very good .NET/Development blogs out there, but there are some which are thinly veiled (sometimes not even veiled!) advertisements. Now, this is understandable when you&#8217;re <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">pimping a product you wrote</a>, but not when <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=003e6a13-aba2-4cef-8515-a9d81b5b23ba">you are, but you didn&#8217;t</a>.</p>


	<p>Take the last link &#8211; he&#8217;s basically selling <a href="http://www.maxivista.com/">MaxiVista&#8217;s</a> product for them<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>He likes it, he&#8217;s talking about it &#8211; fair enough.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>...I hear you say. Wrong &#8211; you&#8217;re missing my point. It&#8217;s not his post I object to, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=fbf0b95f-3fb4-4d46-ac71-8b3158895dad">comments</a> to an earlier <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=fbf0b95f-3fb4-4d46-ac71-8b3158895dad">post</a> about using said product. This is a very tame example, but you see it time and again &#8211; a blogging &#8216;personality&#8217; promotes his favorite product(s) and people flock behind them to buy said product(s). All too often this is done without checking out the <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">competition</a> (which is well worth checking out by the way &#8211; even just for the &#8220;wow that&#8217;s cool&#8221; factor).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve done it myself with <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/?section=/products/NET/Coderush">CodeRush</a> &#8211; I heard it mentioned on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/dotnetrocks/">.NET Rocks</a> and thought:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>They&#8217;re using it &#8211; it must be cool! I&#8217;ll use it, and I&#8217;ll be a cool developer just like them!</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p><em>Time like these I wish I could be bothered to draw stick figures like <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/">Rory</a> does</em></p>


	<p>I tried it. I quite liked it actually. I let the demo expire and stopped using it. And you know what? It didn&#8217;t make any difference &#8211; I still code the same, I just have less flashy effects going on! Yes CodeRush does other things, but so do other (free) VS.NET add-ins.</p>


	<p>Now, I understand the basics of marketing and why things work this way, but it still frustrates me especially when there are so many as-good-as (and often better) Free and/or Open Source alternatives out there. They just don&#8217;t get pimped (in the right places) as much&#8230;</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Why would anyone <strong>not</strong> use <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> ?</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/">Info-ZIP</a> and <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~nulifetv/freezip/">FreeZip</a> should fulfill your needs, but I do admit to using WinZip on my work machine because we have license agreement. I still use Info-ZIP though&#8230;</p>
