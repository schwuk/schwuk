<p>I feel I need to clarify a few points about my previous post &#8220;<a href="/entries/44/we-are-sheep-take-our-money">We are sheep, take our money&#8230;</a>&#8221;.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>I have <strong>no</strong> issues with <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> or what he posts to his blog</li>
		<li>I have <strong>no</strong> issues with <a href="http://www.maxivista.com/">MaxiVista</a> or their product</li>
		<li>I mistakenly compared <a href="http://www.maxivista.com/">MaxiVista</a> to <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy</a> &#8211; they are completely different products which should have been obvious to me</li>
		<li>I <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want to stop people talking about things they find cool</li>
		<li>I <strong>do</strong> want people to stop wasting money on commercial software when there are perfectly good Free and Open Source alternatives out there</li>
		<li>I <strong>do</strong> want people to contribute (time and effort, not just money) to Free and Open Source alternatives</li>
	</ol>


	<p>In a nutshell, my examples within that post were wrong, but my reasons were right. I didn&#8217;t write the entry because of Scott&#8217;s posts about MaxiVista &#8211; they simply reminded me of an annoyance I&#8217;d been meaning to voice for some time.</p>


	<p>I know why there is such a market for <span class="caps">IDE</span> add-ins and developer tools, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I need to agree with it. I also lament the fact that more and more developers are growing up in a world of wizards and add-ins, where development is more a matter of bolting pieces together rather than solving a problem.</p>


	<p>In my <a href="entries/10/why-net">Why .NET?</a> entry I said:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>As far as desktop application development is concerned, itâ??s not currently going to win many .NET developers over â?? in fact I can imagine more Mono developers jumping to .NET once theyâ??ve got to grips with the concepts.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Which in hindsight isn&#8217;t completely fair &#8211; VS.NET is an excellent <span class="caps">IDE</span> which MonoDevelop cannot hope to compete with (yet), but Mono itself is almost as complete as the .NET <span class="caps">SDK</span> and Framework. The problem is that very few .NET developers learnt via the <span class="caps">SDK</span>[1]. If more had gone that route, then they would take to Mono like a duck to water &#8211; but as long as they are being taught to use a wizard over a tool (e.g. The VS.NET &#8220;Add Web Reference&#8221; wizard vs. the <span class="caps">WSDL SDK</span> tool) then they will always have trouble adapting.</p>


	<p>Whilst the main thrust of these entries is directed towards developers, the same sentiments could be applied to all computer users&#8230;</p>
