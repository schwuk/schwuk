	<p>OK, it&#8217;s not true yet, but it will be&#8230;</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve decided to live by the phrase</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p> Eat your own dog food</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>and switch my personal site over to Mono. I can hardly go around extolling the virtues of Mono for web applications when I run a <span class="caps">PHP</span>-based <span class="caps">CMS</span> can I?</p>


	<p>Of course it is very early days yet, and I&#8217;ve got a long way to go before I can replace <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> fully. What I can do though is re-implement the presentation layer, so that is where I have started&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Show me something!</h3>


	<p>After some experimentation today. I have now got an <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET page up and running that talks to my MySQL database that stores the Textpattern data. You can view it <a href="/wip/titlelist.aspx">here</a> &#8211; go try it out!</p>


	<p><ins>Update</ins></p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve revised the page somewhat, blending it with the rest of my site, adding more information and changing controls.</p>


	<h3>Decisions, decisions</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;ll remain with MySQL &#8211; PostgreSQL provides the features (Stored Procedures, Triggers) that I&#8217;m already used to developing with/for on <span class="caps">MS SQL</span> &#8211; it seems stupid to me to go back to building <span class="caps">SQL</span> statements on the fly. I know MySQL has/will have these, but PostgreSQL has them now.</p>


	<p>Besides, if I make that switch I can keep the <span class="caps">LAMP</span> acronym &#8211; it will just mean Linux Apache Mono PostgreSQL instead of Linux Apache MySQL <span class="caps">PHP</span>/Python/Perl. :)</p>
