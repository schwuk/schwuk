<p>Had to post about this&#8230;</p>


	<p>Following on from my recent experiences with <a href="/entries/41/user-unfriendly">printing in Linux</a> I&#8217;ve just had cause to print from Ubuntu for the first time.</p>


	<p>It worked.</p>


	<p>First time.</p>


	<p>I was well and truly gobsmacked. I fired up the printer configuration tool and select &#8220;New Printer&#8221; thinking &#8220;here we go&#8221;, and it came straight up with my printer. All I had to do was select a driver and confirm paper size etc.</p>


	<p>Wow.</p>
