<p>...possibly in the Alanis Morrissette sense&#8230;</p>


	<p>After a few teething troubles, I&#8217;ve now migrated from a variety of aggregrators (including the Mono app <a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/blam/">Blam</a> which is <em>almost</em> there&#8230;) to <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>.</p>


	<p>Bloglines is an excellent service, and once I got used to it&#8217;s quirks I love having my feeds available anywhere, and I&#8217;ve been playing with their <a href="http://bloglines.com/services/api/">web services</a> as well (more to come on that).</p>


	<p>Now on to the bit which made me laugh today&#8230;</p>


	<p>Logging into Bloglines this morning presented me with a &#8220;recommended feeds&#8221; page which included&#8230;this site! I know Bloglines couldn&#8217;t know this site was mine, but I still found it funny that it thought my site should go with the rest of my reading (mainly techy/geeky blogs). Must be doing something right!</p>
