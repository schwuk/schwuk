title: I am so unfit...

<p>One of our cars has decided to start playing up &#8211; brakes pads by the sounds of it &#8211; so it went into the mechanics this morning.</p>


	<p>In a fit of healthy-mindedness, I decided to drive the car there, and bike back. Now it&#8217;s been at least two years since I rode a bike in anger, but it&#8217;s only about 5 miles &#8211; should be easy right? Right?</p>


	<p>Well to be honest, it wasn&#8217;t that bad<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> (and I even went a long way round for a nicer/quieter ride) which pushed it up to 6 or 7 miles, but I was absolutely knackered when I got back!</p>


	<p>Time to start getting fit again methinks&#8230;</p>

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Except for the fact that both tyres were flat, and when I started pumping up the front one it sounded like there was a masive puncture (which I still can&#8217;t find &#8211; valve must have been stuck) so it was a quick inner tube replace. Oh and the brakes squealed like a stuck pig for the first mile or so!</p>
