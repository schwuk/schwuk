<p><a href="http://www.jonobacon.org">Jono</a> has set up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> for use by the <a href="http://infopoint.jonobacon.org">infopoint project</a> &#8211; go check it out.</p>


	<p>This is my first real experience of using a wiki &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen them on other sites, and understand the concepts behind them, but I&#8217;ve never identified them as being useful for myself or some of the solutions I implement. Having now used it for a few days and got my head round the concepts <em>and</em> the mechanics, I now understand how useful they are and why some people swear by them.</p>


	<p>Before using the infopoint wiki, I would probably have implemented some form of bespoke <span class="caps">CMS</span> that satisfied the needs of the project. The trouble is, those needs need identifying before you can write the <span class="caps">CMS</span>. Then you have all the hassle of changing things (or potentially everything) when you realise they don&#8217;t quite meet your requirements. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a> wrote in &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201835959">The Mythical Man Month</a>&#8221;:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.</p>

	<p>Using a wiki allowed the site to get off to a flying start (I like to think I&#8217;ve <a href="http://infopoint.jonobacon.org/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;target=Schwuk">contributed</a> a fair bit towards that!), and once we find that pieces outgrow the contraints of the wiki (e.g. dynamic pages), they can be implemented based on what we&#8217;ve learnt from using the wiki.</p>


	<p>This has led me to re-evaluate how I think of wikis, and I can now see several instances where I can implement them both professionally and personally. On which note, here are several interesting projects I&#8217;d like to highlight:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> &#8211; a personal wiki for Linux/Unix, implemented in Mono</li>
		<li><a href="http://mspace.berlios.de/gunther-user/view.php/page/WebNotes">WebNotes</a> &#8211; another personal wiki, also implemented in Mono. This is nowhere near as polished as Tomboy &#8211; instead it is simply a Mozilla/Gecko wrapper that points to a local <a href="http://www.didiwiki.org/">DidiWiki</a> server</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.webdav.org/wiki/projects/SubWiki">Sub Wiki</a> &#8211; a wiki that uses <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> as its storage mechanism. Wikis normally use their own change control/storage so it&#8217;s nice to see an existing solution being leveraged. I found this one via the <a href="http://www.subversionary.org/">Subversionary</a> website &#8211; a useful support site for Subversion</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.edgewall.com/products/trac/">Trac</a> &#8211; &#8220;<em>an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development projects</em>&#8221; that integrates with Subversion</li>
	</ul>
