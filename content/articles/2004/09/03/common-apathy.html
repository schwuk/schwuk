<p><a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/">Jono Bacon</a> talks about <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=378">toolkit differences on Linux and how to resolve them</a>.</p>


	<p>First of all I was just going to add a comment to his post, but I decided to post here instead. Then my original post was going to be about how this is a nice idea but isn&#8217;t really a big deal &#8211; look at all the different toolkits and UI components on Windows (especially Microsoft apps!) or Apple happily ignoring their own <acronym title="Human Interface Guidelines">HIG</acronym> with their &#8216;brushed metal&#8217; iApps (these are now in their <span class="caps">HIG</span> though) &#8211; but then I started thinking about it a bit more&#8230;</p>


	<h3>As a user</h3>


	<p>The main reasons<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> I prefer <a href="http://gnome.org/"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></a> over <a href="http://kde.org/"><span class="caps">KDE</span></a> a) the fact that one is a Desktop Environment (DE) that runs applications and the other is a bunch of applications that make up a DE (I&#8217;ll let you figure out which is which&#8230;)  and b) the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> <em>feels</em> more consistant than <span class="caps">KDE</span>. Sure, <span class="caps">KDE</span> is more consistant as long as you are using the bundled apps, but thanks to the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/"><span class="caps">HIG</span></a> you can pick up a <span class="caps">GNOME</span> app from the &#8216;net and it will feel like part of the desktop.</p>


	<p>Because of this I (sub)conciously<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> choose <a href="http://www.gtk.org/"><span class="caps">GTK</span>+</a> / <span class="caps">GNOME</span> apps over their <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/">QT</a> / <span class="caps">KDE</span> counterparts when googling for apps and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>


	<p>For example: <a href="http://quanta.sourceforge.net/">Quanta Plus</a> seems like a great web development tool (although it desperately needs a new website, but that&#8217;s a post for another day) but it really looks out of place on my desktop, so I&#8217;m more likely to look at <a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/">Bluefish</a> or <a href="http://www.screem.org/">Screem</a> for my needs.</p>


	<h3>As a developer</h3>


	<p>When I&#8217;m developing applications, I strive to make them look &#8216;natural&#8217;. This means that they look like part of the desktop they are running on by either following the <span class="caps">GNOME HIG</span> or supporting Windows XP themes (ridiculously <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemwindowsformsapplicationclassenablevisualstylestopic.asp">easy</a> with .NET 1.1) and using the common dialogs.</p>


	<p>Far too many &#8216;developers&#8217; are obsessed with making their application stand out with skins, themes and strange interface designs &#8211; at a recent <a href="http://www.cumbria.lug.org.uk"><span class="caps">LUG</span></a> conversation we discussed media players and how Russ &#38; Jen preferred <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">Foobar2000</a> over the likes of <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> because it just looks like a Microsoft Windows application, not a miniature stereo system or whatever.</p>


	<p>Instead, they should be letting their choice of toolkit do the heavy lifting for them and concentrating on functionality and usability.</p>


	<p>So, getting back to Jono&#8217;s idea, if there was an interface that would allow me to call the common dialogs of whichever DE my application was running in, I would use it. This shouldn&#8217;t just be a purely technical solution though &#8211; maybe <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org</a> could produce some sort of <em>meta</em> Human Interface Guidelines to help educate people.</p>


	<h3>Apathetic</h3>


	<p>Now, going back to my original idea for this post &#8211; how having different toolkits/dialogs wasn&#8217;t that big a deal &#8211; I realised I was being apathetic. Just because other operating systems have these discrepancies doesn&#8217;t mean Linux should emulate them. Kudos to Jono for actually trying to do something about it.</p>


<hr />

	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Reason c) is simply that I prefer the <span class="caps">GTK</span>+ apps.</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Reason d) is that I really don&#8217;t care how good your app is <strong>it&#8217;s name doesn&#8217;t need to start with a K just bescause it&#8217;s running on <span class="caps">KDE</span>!</strong></p>
