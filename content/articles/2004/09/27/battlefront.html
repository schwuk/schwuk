	<p>Mat came round yesterday and we spent most of last night playing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZXA88">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> on his Xbox in splitscreen mode. It&#8217;s a truly excellent game that really captures the feeling of &#8216;being there<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>&#8217;, and I can&#8217;t wait to try it on <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/live/">Xbox Live</a> when I <strong>finally</strong> get broadband.</p>


	<p>Gameplay is similar to other squad based shooters &#8211; pick a class and try and meet objectives. In all of the missions I played, the objectives are essentially &#8216;Domination&#8217; from Unreal Tournament &#8211; convert all the &#8216;bases&#8217; to your colour. Like UT, you have to hang around the bases (or command posts) for while to capture then convert it to your side.</p>


	<p>As usual with these sort of games, the &#8216;grunt classes&#8217; are the best all rounders, but you can make use of the other classes, especially the snipers. I can imagine the classes being more use on Live where you&#8217;re actually playing with people and can plan attacks.</p>


	<p>You also get to control vehicles, from AT-STs to Snowspeeders to Speeder Bikes.</p>


	<p>We mainly played the &#8216;Historic Campaign &#8211; Galactic Civil War&#8217; which is episodes IV &#8211; VI. You get to play set pieces from the films &#8211; routing the rebels from Mos Eisley, the battle for the shield generator on Endor etc. &#8211; which are intermixed with footage from the films. The Hoth battle is fantastic, with Snow Speeders flying between the legs of the AT-ATs and Tauntauns running around.</p>


	<p>In campaign mode, your side is chosen for you &#8211; one level you may be the Imperial Forces, the next the Rebels.</p>


	<p>I recommend playing it, especially if you&#8217;re a fan of the films.</p>


	<p><ins>Update</ins></p>


	<p>Got a bit confused between my UT game types &#8211; in Domination you just had to run over the base to capture it, in Onslaught you had to destroy and build the base to capture it (and build a link). Battlefront is more like Domination in that you have capture the bases, not link them, but also like Onslaught in that you have to &#8216;destroy&#8217; and &#8216;build&#8217; the bases by hanging around them, rather than just &#8216;touching&#8217; them.</p>
