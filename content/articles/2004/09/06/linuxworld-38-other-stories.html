<p>Just booked my train tickets and registered for the <a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.co.uk/">LinuxWorld Expo 2004</a>. I&#8217;m only going down for the first day, and not planning on attending the conferences (unless I can get them cheap on the day), but it should be good fun.</p>


	<p>Let me <a href="/static/5/contact">know</a> if you&#8217;re planning on attending&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Google Hacks</h3>


	<p>I was browsing in <a href="http://www.ottakars.co.uk">Ottakar&#8217;s</a> in Carlisle yesterday, and I picked up the O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/googlehks/">Google Hacks</a> book &#8211; I already have their <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wirelesshks">Wireless Hacks</a> and wondered how they managed to fill an entire book about Google &#8211; as I was flicking through the pages a familiar <span class="caps">URL</span> caught my eye. Once I found the page again I discovered the <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/aqgoogle/">Google Art Creator</a> by <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">Aq</a>. It&#8217;s weird seeing people you know in books&#8230;</p>


	<h3>On which note&#8230;</h3>


	<p>I also picked up the latest <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format</a> (mainly for <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo 2004.2</a> on the cover <span class="caps">DVD</span> &#8211; I can finally buy magazines with DVDs!) and amongst the rest of a very good issue there was Jono&#8217;s latest part of his &#8216;KDE Development&#8217; series where I spotted a <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=album07&#38;id=P1010018">picture</a> of Jono and Digit0 at LUDEx 2004 (pg.87). Then in the thumbnails to the left I saw some more of his LUDEx photos including two ( <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=album07&#38;id=P1010019">1</a> <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=album07&#38;id=P1010020">2</a> ) of me (the last one was cut in half though). Freaky&#8230;</p>
