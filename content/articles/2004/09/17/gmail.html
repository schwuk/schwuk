<p>Thanks to my friend Adam I now have a <a href="http://gmail.google.com">Gmail</a> account<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. As soon as get some invites, I&#8217;ll start dishing them out &#8211; in the meantime&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Gmail invites to spare?</h3>


	<p>Found the <a href="http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php">Gmail invite spooler</a> via <a href="http://forevergeek.com/geek_resources/free_gmail_invites_all_you_can_eat.php">Forever Geek</a>. If you&#8217;ve got invites to spare, send &#8216;em to it. If you want one, give them your address.</p>


	<p>Unfortunately I can&#8217;t vouch for how well it works as I registered for mine shortly before my <a href="/entries/31/oops">domain disappeared</a> and hence my email was <acronym title="Missing In Action">MIA</acronym> as well. Then by co-incidence Adam sent me one. Good man.</p>


	<h3>First impressions</h3>


	<p>Good. Very good in fact.</p>


	<p>Nice clean interface. I like the way conversations are threaded (although it confused me at first). The ads aren&#8217;t obtrusive/annoying and are relevant to your email. Not had chance to play with search due to having very few emails in there, but all-in-all a nice webmail system.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re using Gmail with Firefox<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> you owe it to yourself to use the <a href="https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=173">Gmail Notifier</a> extension.</p>

	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> 1.0 <span class="caps">PR1</span> is out and is good. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Try it</a></p>
