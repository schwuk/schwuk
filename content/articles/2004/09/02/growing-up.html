<p>This quote from the last entry on my <a href="http://www.schwuk.com/archives/spp/">old site</a> makes me chuckle&#8230;</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I am currently working on a few new sites, and a games review site is one of them, so keep watching&#8230;</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Apart from the fact that a) it was nearly two years between the previous entry and that one and b) it was another three years before I seriously updated the site (holding pages not included), it was that I wanted to do another games site.</p>


	<p>Back then, and in fact up until recently, I was seriously into games. Spent a fortune on them (ask my wife!). I had my Dreamcast on the day of release. I pre-ordered and queued up at midnight for my Playstation 2. I had a GeForce 256 practically as they came out. I used to spend <strong>hours</strong> on Unreal Tournament online. I had to have most games on their day of release, and regularly bought several games a month. A <strong>week</strong> sometimes.</p>


	<p>Now&#8230;nothing.</p>


	<p>I still own:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Playstation (original &#8211; not PSOne)</li>
		<li>Nintendo 64</li>
		<li>Dreamcast</li>
		<li>Playstation 2</li>
		<li>Gameboy Advance</li>
		<li>X-Box</li>
		<li>A GeForce Ti4600 128MB</li>
		<li><strong>Lots</strong> of games for them all</li>
	</ul>


	<p>But I don&#8217;t play them. At all. The X-Box sees occasional use as a <span class="caps">DVD</span> Player in the bedroom, but that&#8217;s it.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s not been a conscious descision &#8211; it&#8217;s just that sometime in the past twelve-to-eighteen months I seem to have grown out of playing games&#8230;</p>
