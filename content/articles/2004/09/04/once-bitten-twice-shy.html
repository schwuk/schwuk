<p>Made an alarming discovery on my XP machine today &#8211; it was infected!</p>


	<p>I noticed it was taking longer and longer to boot up, and being fairly unresponsive at times even though nothing was happening. Then the dreaded happened &#8211; the &#8216;unrelated&#8217; pop-up window when accidently launching Internet Explorer. This set alarm bells ringing and a quick scan of my task list highlighted two suspects &#8211; <a href="http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/bargains/">bargains.exe</a> and <a href="http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/msbb/">msbb.exe</a>.</p>


	<p>I downloaded <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/">Ad-Aware</a> to try and remove them, but I checked the registry beforehand to see where they were being launched from, and after Ad-Aware claimed to have &#8216;quarantined&#8221; them, the entries were still there.</p>


	<p>I decided not to risk it, and proceeded with a re-build (all of my data lives on other drives or another machine), followed by <span class="caps">SP2</span> and then for the first time ever Anti-Virus! I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of Anti-Virus, believing instead that being sensible was better protection. I still do, and I believe my machine got infected through my own stupidity (I can trace the infection down to one of three actions), but still I decided to bite the bullet and take advantage of Computer Associates offer in conjunction with Microsoft of <a href="http://www.my-etrust.com/microsoft/">12 months free Anti-Virus and Firewall</a>.</p>


	<p>The Anti-Virus does what it&#8217;s supposed to, and the firewall appears to be branded version of <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/">ZoneAlarm</a> which is very good if you want to know <strong>everything</strong> your computer is sending/receiving.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m tempted to ditch my XP partition though, and invest in a copy of VMWare for those times that I really need it. Of course, if I can get my <a href="http://www.umax.de/eu/Scanner/astra6400.htm">scanner</a> working with Linux I shouldn&#8217;t need XP anymore&#8230;</p>
